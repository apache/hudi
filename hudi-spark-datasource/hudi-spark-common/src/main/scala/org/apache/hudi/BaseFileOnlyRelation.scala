/**
 * [[BaseRelation]] implementation only reading Base files of Hudi tables, essentially supporting following querying
 * modes:
 * <ul>
 * <li>For COW tables: Snapshot</li>
 * <li>For MOR tables: Read-optimized</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * NOTE: The reason this Relation is used in liue of Spark's default [[HadoopFsRelation]] is primarily due to the
 * fact that it injects real partition's path as the value of the partition field, which Hudi ultimately persists
 * as part of the record payload. In some cases, however, partition path might not necessarily be equal to the
 * verbatim value of the partition path field (when custom [[KeyGenerator]] is used) therefore leading to incorrect
 * partition field values being written
