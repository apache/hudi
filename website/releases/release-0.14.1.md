## Known Regressions
We discovered a regression in Hudi 0.14.1 release related to Complex Key gen when record key consists of one field. 
It can silently ingest duplicates if table is upgraded from previous versions.

:::tip
Avoid upgrading any existing table to 0.14.1 if you are using ComplexKeyGenerator and number of fields in record key is 1.
