## [Release 0.12.3](https://github.com/apache/hudi/releases/tag/release-0.12.3) ([docs](/docs/0.12.3/quick-start-guide))

## Long Term Support

We aim to maintain 0.12 for a longer period of time and provide a stable release through the latest 0.12.x release for
users to migrate to.  This release (0.12.3) is the latest 0.12 release.

## Migration Guide

* This release (0.12.3) does not introduce any new table version, thus no migration is needed if you are on 0.12.0.

  [0.11.0](/releases/release-0.11.0), and [0.12.0](/releases/release-0.12.0).
