### Bug fixes

The 1.0.2 release primarily focuses on bug fixes, stability enhancements, and critical improvements, particularly around migration and backwards compatibility. The changes span across various components, including:

* **Metadata Table (MDT):** Numerous fixes and improvements related to validation, writing, reading, compaction, indexing (column stats), and backwards compatibility (especially for table version 6).
* **Spark Integration:** Enhancements and fixes for Spark SQL (MERGE INTO, query behavior), datasource reader/writer, schema handling, performance, and backward compatibility.
* **Backwards Compatibility:** Significant effort ensuring compatibility with older table versions (specifically v6) and smoother upgrades from 0.x versions, including dedicated writers/readers.
* **File Group Reader:** Validation, fixes, and feature completeness improvements, including making it default for table version 6.
* **Flink Engine:** Fixes and improvements related to streamer checkpoints and bundle validation.
* **Compaction and Table Services:** Fixes related to compaction scheduling, execution (especially with global index or RLI), archival, and cleanup.
* **Indexing:** Fixes and enhancements for Column Stats, Record Level Index (RLI), and Bloom Filters.
* **Performance:** Optimizations in areas like log file writing, schema reuse, and metadata initialization.
* **Testing, CI, and Dependencies:** Fixes for flaky tests, improved code coverage, bundle validation, dependency cleanup (HBase removal), and extensive release testing.
