This page describes support for creating and altering tables using SQL across various engines. 

## Spark SQL

### Create table 

You can create tables using standard CREATE TABLE syntax, which supports partitioning and passing table properties.

```sql
CREATE TABLE [IF NOT EXISTS] [db_name.]table_name
  [(col_name data_type [COMMENT col_comment], ...)]
  [COMMENT table_comment]
  [PARTITIONED BY (col_name, ...)]
  [ROW FORMAT row_format]
  [STORED AS file_format]
  [LOCATION path]
  [TBLPROPERTIES (property_name=property_value, ...)]
  [AS select_statement];
```

:::note NOTE:
For users running this tutorial locally and have a Spark-Hive(HMS) integration in their environment: If you use 
`default` database or if you don't provide `[LOCATION path]` with the DDL statement, Spark will return 
`java.io.IOException: Mkdirs failed to create file:/user/hive/warehouse/hudi_table/.hoodie` error. 
To get around this, you can follow either of the two options mentioned below:
1. Create a database i.e. `CREATE DATABASE hudidb;` and use it i.e. `USE hudidb;` before running the DDL statement.
2. Or provide a path using `LOCATION` keyword to persist the data with the DDL statement.
:::

### Create non-partitioned table

Creating a non-partitioned table is as simple as creating a regular table.

```sql
-- create a Hudi table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS hudi_table (
  id INT,
  name STRING,
  price DOUBLE
) USING hudi;
```

### Create partitioned table
A partitioned table can be created by adding a `partitioned by` clause. Partitioning helps to organize the data into multiple folders 
based on the partition columns. It can also help speed up queries and index lookups by limiting the amount of metadata, index and data scanned.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS hudi_table_partitioned (
  id BIGINT,
  name STRING,
  dt STRING,
  hh STRING
) USING hudi
TBLPROPERTIES (
  type = 'cow'
)
PARTITIONED BY (dt);
```

:::note
You can also create a table partitioned by multiple fields by supplying comma-separated field names.
When creating a table partitioned by multiple fields, ensure that you specify the columns in the `PARTITIONED BY` clause 
in the same order as they appear in the `CREATE TABLE` schema. For example, for the above table, the partition fields 
should be specified as `PARTITIONED BY (dt, hh)`.
:::

### Create table with record keys and ordering fields

As discussed [here](quick-start-guide.md#keys), tables track each record in the table using a record key. Hudi auto-generated a highly compressed 
key for each new record in the examples so far. If you want to use an existing field as the key, you can set the `primaryKey` option. 
Typically, this is also accompanied by configuring ordering fields (via `orderingFields` option) to deal with out-of-order data and potential 
duplicate records with the same key in the incoming writes.

:::note
You can choose multiple fields as primary keys for a given table on a need basis. For eg, "primaryKey = 'id, name'", and
this materializes a composite key of the two fields, which can be useful for exploring the table.
:::

Here is an example of creating a table using both options. Typically, a field that denotes the time of the event or
fact, e.g., order creation time, event generation time etc., is used as the ordering field (via `orderingFields`). Hudi resolves multiple versions
of the same record by ordering based on this field when queries are run on the table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS hudi_table_keyed (
  id INT,
  name STRING,
  price DOUBLE,
  ts BIGINT
) USING hudi
TBLPROPERTIES (
  type = 'cow',
  primaryKey = 'id',
  orderingFields = 'ts'
);
```

### Create table with merge modes {#create-table-with-record-merge-mode}

Hudi supports different [record merge modes](record_merger.md) to handle merge of incoming records with existing
records. To create a table with specific record merge mode, you can set `recordMergeMode` option.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS hudi_table_merge_mode (
  id INT,
  name STRING,
  ts LONG,
  price DOUBLE
) USING hudi
TBLPROPERTIES (
  type = 'mor',
  primaryKey = 'id',
  orderingFields = 'ts',
  recordMergeMode = 'EVENT_TIME_ORDERING'
)
LOCATION 'file:///tmp/hudi_table_merge_mode/';
```

With `EVENT_TIME_ORDERING`, the record with the larger event time (specified via `orderingFields`) overwrites the record with the
smaller event time on the same key, regardless of transaction's commit time. Users can set `CUSTOM` mode to provide their own
merge logic. With `CUSTOM` merge mode, you can provide a custom class that implements the merge logic. The interfaces 
to implement is explained in detail [here](record_merger.md#custom).

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS hudi_table_merge_mode_custom (
  id INT,
  name STRING,
  ts LONG,
  price DOUBLE
) USING hudi
TBLPROPERTIES (
  type = 'mor',
  primaryKey = 'id',
  orderingFields = 'ts',
  recordMergeMode = 'CUSTOM',
  'hoodie.record.merge.strategy.id' = '<unique-uuid>'
)
LOCATION 'file:///tmp/hudi_table_merge_mode_custom/';
```

### Create table with unstructured and semi-structured column types {#create-table-with-unstructured-and-semi-structured-column-types}

Hudi supports three column types for unstructured and semi-structured data, plus a Lance base file
format.

#### `VECTOR(dim[, elementType])` {#vector}

A fixed-dimension embedding column. `elementType` is one of `FLOAT` (default), `DOUBLE`, or `INT8`
(alias `BYTE`):

| Element type | Storage |
|:-------------|:--------|
| `FLOAT` (default) | `ArrayType(FloatType)` |
| `DOUBLE` | `ArrayType(DoubleType)` |
| `INT8` / `BYTE` | `ArrayType(ByteType)` |

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id   STRING,
    name         STRING,
    embedding    VECTOR(768)          -- defaults to FLOAT
) USING hudi
TBLPROPERTIES (
    primaryKey = 'product_id',
    type = 'cow',
    hoodie.record.merger.impls = 'org.apache.hudi.DefaultSparkRecordMerger'
);

-- Other element types
-- embedding VECTOR(768, FLOAT)
-- embedding VECTOR(768, DOUBLE)
-- embedding VECTOR(256, INT8)
```

Hudi's SQL parser normalizes `VECTOR(128, FLOAT)` to `VECTOR(128)`.

VECTOR columns must be **top-level fields**; nesting inside `STRUCT`, `ARRAY`, or `MAP` is not
supported. Dimension and element type cannot be changed via schema evolution after table creation.

**Internal storage.** In Parquet, a VECTOR column is stored as `FIXED_LEN_BYTE_ARRAY` with
`hudi_type=VECTOR(dim[,elementType])` field metadata so the Spark reader decodes the bytes back into
a typed array. On Lance-backed tables, VECTOR is stored natively as
`FixedSizeList<Float32/Float64, dim>`; only `FLOAT` and `DOUBLE` element types are accepted on Lance.

Query VECTOR columns with the [`hudi_vector_search` TVF](sql_queries.md#vector-similarity-search).

**Engine constraints.** Flink cannot decode VECTOR columns (the underlying Parquet
`FIXED_LEN_BYTE_ARRAY` is not converted back into a typed array); Flink can still read other columns
in a table that contains a VECTOR column.

#### `BLOB` {#blob}

A binary column with two storage modes:

| Mode | Storage | Read pattern |
|:-----|:--------|:-------------|
| `INLINE` | Raw bytes embedded in the table row | Direct read; no external fetch |
| `OUT_OF_LINE` | Pointer to a byte range in an external file | On-demand via [`read_blob()`](sql_queries.md#reading-blob-columns) |

```sql
CREATE TABLE media_assets (
    asset_id    STRING,
    file_name   STRING,
    mime_type   STRING,
    file_size   BIGINT,
    content     BLOB
) USING hudi
TBLPROPERTIES (
    primaryKey = 'asset_id',
    type = 'cow'
);
```

**Internal struct.** A BLOB column is represented internally as:

```
STRUCT<
  type:      STRING,        -- 'INLINE' or 'OUT_OF_LINE'
  data:      BINARY,        -- raw bytes for INLINE; null for OUT_OF_LINE
  reference: STRUCT<
    external_path: STRING,  -- file path for OUT_OF_LINE
    offset:        BIGINT,  -- byte offset; null = start of file
    length:        BIGINT,  -- byte length; null = read to end
    managed:       BOOLEAN  -- advisory flag for the (future) cleaner
  >
>
```

`managed` is currently advisory: `true` records the intent that Hudi owns the lifecycle of the
referenced external file (so a future cleaner may delete it when no row references it), `false`
records that the file is externally managed. The cleaner does not yet consume this field.

BLOB columns are excluded from column-stats indexing.

#### `VARIANT` {#variant}

A semi-structured (JSON-like) column that stores any JSON-compatible value (object, array, string,
number, boolean, null) as two binary fields:

| Field | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| `metadata` | Encodes field names, types, and structure for efficient access |
| `value` | The data payload |

On Spark 4.0+, declare the native type:

```sql
CREATE TABLE events (
    event_id  STRING,
    payload   VARIANT,
    ts        BIGINT
) USING hudi
TBLPROPERTIES (
    primaryKey = 'event_id',
    preCombineField = 'ts'
);
```

Spark 3.x has no native `VariantType`. To read a VARIANT-bearing Hudi table written by Spark 4.x,
declare the column as a binary struct in the `CREATE TABLE` DDL pointing at the table location:

```sql
CREATE TABLE events (
    event_id  STRING,
    payload   STRUCT<value: BINARY, metadata: BINARY>,
    ts        BIGINT
) USING hudi
LOCATION '<existing-table-path>'
TBLPROPERTIES (
    primaryKey = 'event_id',
    preCombineField = 'ts'
);
```

Spark 3.x then returns the raw `metadata` and `value` bytes; it does not surface the column as a
logical VARIANT, and reading a VARIANT table without this explicit DDL (i.e. letting Hudi
auto-resolve the schema from commit metadata) throws `"VARIANT type is only supported in Spark
4.0+"`.

Engine support for `VARIANT`:

| Engine | Behavior |
|:-------|:---------|
| Spark 4.0+ | Native `VariantType` for read/write/query on COW and MOR (CREATE TABLE with `VARIANT` or DataFrame writes with `VariantType`). |
| Spark 4.1 | Same as Spark 4.0. Spark 4.1's `PushVariantIntoScan` rewrites VARIANT projections into struct-of-extractions; Hudi recognizes that shape and returns the column as a logical VARIANT. |
| Spark 3.x | No native VARIANT. Backward-compat read of a Spark 4.x-written table requires the explicit binary-struct DDL above; raw bytes only. |
| Flink &lt; 2.1 | Throws `UnsupportedOperationException` on VARIANT columns. |
| Flink ≥ 2.1 | Surfaces VARIANT as `ROW<metadata BYTES, value BYTES>`. Flink can read the underlying struct but cannot decode it as a variant value. |

VARIANT columns are not supported on Lance-backed tables.

Only unshredded VARIANT is exposed at the user-facing level: every Spark/Hudi schema conversion
produces an unshredded VARIANT (two binary fields, `metadata` and `value`). The shredded variant
write path exists in the engine but has no DDL, table-property, or session-config to enable it.

#### Lance base file format

Set the base file format per-table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE my_ai_table (
    id        STRING,
    embedding VECTOR(768),
    metadata  STRING
) USING hudi
TBLPROPERTIES (
    primaryKey = 'id',
    type = 'cow',
    hoodie.record.merger.impls = 'org.apache.hudi.DefaultSparkRecordMerger',
    hoodie.table.base.file.format = 'lance'
);
```

Lance also works with MOR tables: Lance files act as base files while Avro log files capture
incremental changes. See [Storage Layouts → Lance](storage_layouts.md#lance-base-file-format) for
configuration, dependencies, and behavior.

### Create table from an external location
Often, Hudi tables are created from streaming writers like the [streamer tool](hoodie_streaming_ingestion.md#hudi-streamer), which
may later need some SQL statements to run on them. You can create an External table using the `location` statement.

```sql
CREATE TABLE hudi_table_external
USING hudi
LOCATION 'file:///tmp/hudi_table/';
```

:::tip
You don't need to specify the schema and any properties except the partitioned columns if they exist. Hudi can automatically
recognize the schema and configurations.
:::

### Create Table As Select (CTAS)

Hudi supports CTAS(Create table as select) to support initial loads into Hudi tables. To ensure this is done efficiently,
even for large loads, CTAS uses **bulk insert** as the write operation

```sql
# create managed parquet table
CREATE TABLE parquet_table
USING parquet
LOCATION 'file:///tmp/parquet_dataset/';

# CTAS by loading data into Hudi table
CREATE TABLE hudi_table_ctas
USING hudi
TBLPROPERTIES (
  type = 'cow',
  orderingFields = 'ts'
)
PARTITIONED BY (dt)
AS SELECT * FROM parquet_table;
```

You can create a non-partitioned table as well

```sql
# create managed parquet table
CREATE TABLE parquet_table
USING parquet
LOCATION 'file:///tmp/parquet_dataset/';

# CTAS by loading data into Hudi table
CREATE TABLE hudi_table_ctas
USING hudi
TBLPROPERTIES (
  type = 'cow',
  orderingFields = 'ts'
)
AS SELECT * FROM parquet_table;
```

If you prefer explicitly setting the record keys, you can do so by setting `primaryKey` config in table properties.

```sql
CREATE TABLE hudi_table_ctas
USING hudi
TBLPROPERTIES (
  type = 'cow',
  primaryKey = 'id'
)
PARTITIONED BY (dt)
AS
SELECT 1 AS id, 'a1' AS name, 10 AS price, 1000 AS dt;
```

You can also use CTAS to copy data across external locations

```sql
# create managed parquet table
CREATE TABLE parquet_table
USING parquet
LOCATION 'file:///tmp/parquet_dataset/*.parquet';

# CTAS by loading data into hudi table
CREATE TABLE hudi_table_ctas
USING hudi
LOCATION 'file:///tmp/hudi/hudi_tbl/'
TBLPROPERTIES (
  type = 'cow'
)
AS SELECT * FROM parquet_table;
```

### Create Index

Hudi supports creating and dropping different types of indexes on a table. For more information on different
type of indexes please refer [multi-modal indexing](indexes.md#multi-modal-indexing). Secondary 
index, expression index and record indexes can be created using SQL create index command.

```sql
-- Create Index
CREATE INDEX [IF NOT EXISTS] index_name ON [TABLE] table_name 
[USING index_type] 
(column_name1 [OPTIONS(key1=value1, key2=value2, ...)], column_name2 [OPTIONS(key1=value1, key2=value2, ...)], ...) 
[OPTIONS (key1=value1, key2=value2, ...)]

-- Record index syntax
CREATE INDEX indexName ON tableIdentifier (primaryKey1 [, primayKey2 ...]);

-- Secondary Index Syntax
CREATE INDEX indexName ON tableIdentifier (nonPrimaryKey);

-- Expression Index Syntax
CREATE INDEX indexName ON tableIdentifier USING column_stats(col) OPTIONS(expr='expr_val', format='format_val');
CREATE INDEX indexName ON tableIdentifier USING bloom_filters(col) OPTIONS(expr='expr_val');

-- Drop Index
DROP INDEX [IF EXISTS] index_name ON [TABLE] table_name
```

- `index_name` is the name of the index to be created or dropped.
- `table_name` is the name of the table on which the index is created or dropped.
- `index_type` is the type of the index to be created. Currently, only `column_stats` and `bloom_filters` is supported. 
   If the `using ..` clause is omitted, a secondary record index is created.
- `column_name` is the name of the column on which the index is created.

Both index and column on which the index is created can be qualified with some options in the form of key-value pairs.

:::note
Please note in order to create secondary index:
1. The table must have a primary key and merge mode should be [COMMIT_TIME_ORDERING](record_merger.md#commit_time_ordering).
2. Record index must be enabled. This can be done by setting `hoodie.metadata.record.index.enable=true` and then creating `record_index`. Please note the example below.
3. Secondary index is not supported for [complex types](https://avro.apache.org/docs/1.11.1/specification/#complex-types).
:::

**Examples**
```sql
-- Create a table with primary key
CREATE TABLE hudi_indexed_table (
    ts BIGINT,
    uuid STRING,
    rider STRING,
    driver STRING,
    fare DOUBLE,
    city STRING
) USING HUDI
options(
    primaryKey ='uuid',
    hoodie.write.record.merge.mode = "COMMIT_TIME_ORDERING"
)
PARTITIONED BY (city);

-- Add some data.
INSERT INTO hudi_indexed_table
VALUES
 ...

-- Create bloom filter expression index on driver column
CREATE INDEX idx_bloom_driver ON hudi_indexed_table USING bloom_filters(driver) OPTIONS(expr='identity');
-- It would show bloom filter expression index
SHOW INDEXES FROM hudi_indexed_table;
-- Query on driver column would prune the data using the idx_bloom_driver index
SELECT uuid, rider FROM hudi_indexed_table WHERE driver = 'driver-S';

-- Create column stat expression index on ts column
CREATE INDEX idx_column_ts ON hudi_indexed_table USING column_stats(ts) OPTIONS(expr='from_unixtime', format = 'yyyy-MM-dd');
-- Shows both expression indexes
SHOW INDEXES FROM hudi_indexed_table;
-- Query on ts column would prune the data using the idx_column_ts index
SELECT * FROM hudi_indexed_table WHERE from_unixtime(ts, 'yyyy-MM-dd') = '2023-09-24';

-- Create secondary index on rider column
CREATE INDEX record_index ON hudi_indexed_table (uuid);
CREATE INDEX idx_rider ON hudi_indexed_table (rider);
SET hoodie.metadata.record.index.enable=true;
-- Expression index and secondary index should show up
SHOW INDEXES FROM hudi_indexed_table;
-- Query on rider column would leverage the secondary index idx_rider
SELECT * FROM hudi_indexed_table WHERE rider = 'rider-E';

```

### Create Expression Index

A [expression index](https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/00ece7bce0a4a8d0019721a28049723821e01842/rfc/rfc-63/rfc-63.md) is an index on a function of a column. 
It is a new addition to Hudi's [multi-modal indexing](https://hudi.apache.org/blog/2022/05/17/Introducing-Multi-Modal-Index-for-the-Lakehouse-in-Apache-Hudi) 
subsystem. Expression indexes can be used to implement logical partitioning of a table, by creating `column_stats` indexes 
on an expression of a column. For e.g. an expression index extracting a date from a timestamp field, can effectively implement 
date based partitioning, provide same benefits to queries, even if the physical layout is different.

```sql
-- Create an expression index on the column `ts` (unix epoch) of the table `hudi_table` using the function `from_unixtime` with the format `yyyy-MM-dd`
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS ts_datestr ON hudi_table 
  USING column_stats(ts) 
  OPTIONS(expr='from_unixtime', format='yyyy-MM-dd');
-- Create an expression index on the column `ts` (timestamp in yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss) of the table `hudi_table` using the function `hour`
CREATE INDEX ts_hour ON hudi_table 
  USING column_stats(ts) 
  options(expr='hour');
```

:::note
1. Expression index can only be created for Spark engine using SQL. It is not supported yet with Spark DataSource API.
2. Expression index is not yet supported for [complex types](https://avro.apache.org/docs/1.11.1/specification/#complex-types).
3. Expression index is supported for unary and certain binary expressions. Please check [SQL DDL docs](sql_ddl.md#create-expression-index) for more details.
   :::

The `expr` option is required for creating expression index, and it should be a valid Spark SQL function. Please check the syntax 
for the above functions in the [Spark SQL documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-ref-functions.html) and provide the options accordingly. For example, 
the `format` option is required for `from_unixtime` function.

Some useful functions that are supported are listed below.

  - `identity`
  - `from_unixtime`
  - `date_format`
  - `to_date`
  - `to_timestamp`
  - `year`
  - `month`
  - `day`
  - `hour`
  - `lower`
  - `upper`
  - `substring`
  - `regexp_extract`
  - `regexp_replace`
  - `concat`
  - `length`

Note that, only functions that take a single column as input are supported currently and UDFs are not supported.

### Create Partition Stats Index

Partition stats index is similar to column stats, in the sense that it tracks - `min, max, null, count, ..` statistics on columns in the 
table, useful in query planning. The key difference being, while `column_stats` tracks statistics about files, the partition_stats index 
tracks aggregated statistics at the storage partition path level, to help more efficiently skip entire folder paths during query planning
and execution. 

To enable partition stats index, simply set `hoodie.metadata.index.partition.stats.enable = 'true'` in create table options.

:::note
1. `column_stats` index is required to be enabled for `partition_stats` index. Both go hand in hand. 
2. `partition_stats` index is not created automatically for all columns. Users must specify list of columns for which they want to create partition stats index.
3. `column_stats` and `partition_stats` index is not yet supported for [complex types](https://avro.apache.org/docs/1.11.1/specification/#complex-types).
:::

### Create Secondary Index

Secondary indexes are record level indexes built on any column in the table. It supports multiple records having the same
secondary column value efficiently and is built on top of the existing record level index built on the table's record key.
Secondary indexes are hash based indexes that offer horizontally scalable write performance by splitting key space into shards 
by hashing, as well as fast lookups by employing row-based file formats.

Let us now look at an example of creating a table with multiple indexes and how the query leverage the indexes for both
partition pruning and data skipping.

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS hudi_table;
-- Let us create a table with multiple partition fields, and enable record index and partition stats index 
CREATE TABLE hudi_table (
    ts BIGINT,
    id STRING,
    rider STRING,
    driver STRING,
    fare DOUBLE,
    city STRING,
    state STRING
) USING hudi
 OPTIONS(
    primaryKey ='id',
    hoodie.metadata.record.index.enable = 'true', -- enable record index
    hoodie.metadata.index.partition.stats.enable = 'true', -- enable partition stats index
    hoodie.metadata.index.column.stats.enable = 'true', -- enable column stats
    hoodie.metadata.index.column.stats.column.list = 'rider', -- create column stats index on rider column
    hoodie.write.record.merge.mode = "COMMIT_TIME_ORDERING" -- enable commit time ordering, required for secondary index
)
PARTITIONED BY (city, state)
LOCATION 'file:///tmp/hudi_test_table';

INSERT INTO hudi_table VALUES (1695159649,'trip1','rider-A','driver-K',19.10,'san_francisco','california');

INSERT INTO hudi_table VALUES (1695332066,'trip3','rider-E','driver-O',93.50,'austin','texas');
INSERT INTO hudi_table VALUES (1695516137,'trip4','rider-F','driver-P',34.15,'houston','texas');

```

### Create Bloom Filter Index

Bloom filter indexes store a bloom filter per file, on the column or column expression being index. It can be very 
effective in skipping files that don't contain a high cardinality column value e.g. uuids.

```sql
-- Create a bloom filter index on the column derived from expression `lower(rider)` of the table `hudi_table`
CREATE INDEX idx_bloom_rider ON hudi_indexed_table USING bloom_filters(rider) OPTIONS(expr='lower');
```

### Setting Hudi configs 

There are different ways you can pass the configs for a given hudi table. 

#### Using set command
You can use the **set** command to set any of Hudi's write configs. This will apply to operations across the whole spark session.

```sql
set hoodie.insert.shuffle.parallelism = 100;
set hoodie.upsert.shuffle.parallelism = 100;
set hoodie.delete.shuffle.parallelism = 100;
```

#### Using table properties
You can also configure table options when creating a table. This will be applied only for the table and override any SET command values.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS tableName (
  colName1 colType1,
  colName2 colType2,
  ...
) USING hudi
TBLPROPERTIES (
  primaryKey = '${colName1}',
  type = 'cow',
  ${hoodie.config.key1} = '${hoodie.config.value1}',
  ${hoodie.config.key2} = '${hoodie.config.value2}',
  ....
);

e.g.
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS hudi_table (
  id BIGINT,
  name STRING,
  price DOUBLE
) USING hudi
TBLPROPERTIES (
  primaryKey = 'id',
  type = 'cow',
  hoodie.cleaner.fileversions.retained = '20',
  hoodie.keep.max.commits = '20'
);
```

### Table Properties

Users can set table properties while creating a table. The important table properties are discussed below.

| Parameter Name | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|------------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| type       | cow | The table type to create. `type = 'cow'` creates a COPY-ON-WRITE table, while `type = 'mor'` creates a MERGE-ON-READ table. Same as `hoodie.datasource.write.table.type`. More details can be found [here](table_types.md)                                                               |
| primaryKey | uuid | The primary key field names of the table separated by commas. Same as `hoodie.datasource.write.recordkey.field`. If this config is ignored, hudi will auto-generate primary keys. If explicitly set, primary key generation will honor user configuration.                                  |
| orderingFields |  | The ordering field(s) of the table. It is used for resolving the final version of the record among multiple versions. Generally, `event time` or another similar column will be used for ordering purposes. Hudi will be able to handle out-of-order data using the ordering field value. |

:::note
`primaryKey`, `orderingFields`, and `type` and other properties are case-sensitive. 
:::

#### Passing Lock Providers for Concurrent Writers

Hudi requires a lock provider to support concurrent writers or asynchronous table services when using OCC
and [NBCC](concurrency_control.md#non-blocking-concurrency-control) (Non-Blocking Concurrency Control)
concurrency mode. For NBCC mode, locking is only used to write the commit metadata file in the timeline. Writes are
serialized by completion time. Users can pass these table properties into *TBLPROPERTIES* as well. Below is an example
for a Zookeeper based configuration.

```sql
-- Properties to use Lock configurations to support Multi Writers
TBLPROPERTIES(
  hoodie.write.lock.zookeeper.url = "zookeeper",
  hoodie.write.lock.zookeeper.port = "2181",
  hoodie.write.lock.zookeeper.lock_key = "tableName",
  hoodie.write.lock.provider = "org.apache.hudi.client.transaction.lock.ZookeeperBasedLockProvider",
  hoodie.write.concurrency.mode = "optimistic_concurrency_control",
  hoodie.write.lock.zookeeper.base_path = "/tableName"
)
```

#### Enabling Column Stats / Record Level Index for the table
Hudi provides the ability to leverage rich metadata and index about the table, speed up DMLs and queries. 
For e.g: collection of column statistics can be enabled to perform quick data skipping or a record-level index can be used to perform fast updates or point lookups 
using the following table properties.


For more, see <a href="/docs/configurations/#Metadata-Configs">Metadata Configurations</a>

```sql
TBLPROPERTIES(
  'hoodie.metadata.index.column.stats.enable' = 'true'
  'hoodie.metadata.record.index.enable' = 'true' 
)
```

### Spark Alter Table
**Syntax**
```sql
-- Alter table name
ALTER TABLE oldTableName RENAME TO newTableName;

-- Alter table add columns
ALTER TABLE tableIdentifier ADD COLUMNS(colAndType [, colAndType]);
```
**Examples**

```sql
--rename to:
ALTER TABLE hudi_table RENAME TO hudi_table_renamed;

--add column:
ALTER TABLE hudi_table ADD COLUMNS(remark STRING);
```

### Modifying Table Properties
**Syntax**
```sql
-- alter table ... set|unset
ALTER TABLE tableIdentifier SET|UNSET TBLPROPERTIES (table_property = 'property_value');
```

**Examples**

```sql
ALTER TABLE hudi_table SET TBLPROPERTIES (hoodie.keep.max.commits = '10');
ALTER TABLE hudi_table SET TBLPROPERTIES ("note" = "don't drop this table");

ALTER TABLE hudi_table UNSET TBLPROPERTIES IF EXISTS (hoodie.keep.max.commits);
ALTER TABLE hudi_table UNSET TBLPROPERTIES IF EXISTS ('note');
```

:::note
Currently, trying to change the column type may throw an error ```ALTER TABLE CHANGE COLUMN is not supported for changing column colName with oldColType to colName with newColType.```, due to an [open SPARK issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-21823)
:::

### Alter config options
You can also alter the write config for a table by the **ALTER TABLE SET SERDEPROPERTIES**

**Syntax**

```sql
-- alter table ... set|unset
ALTER TABLE tableName SET SERDEPROPERTIES ('property' = 'property_value');
```

**Example**
```sql
 ALTER TABLE hudi_table SET SERDEPROPERTIES ('key1' = 'value1');
```

### Show and drop partitions

**Syntax**

```sql
-- Show partitions
SHOW PARTITIONS tableIdentifier;

-- Drop partition
ALTER TABLE tableIdentifier DROP PARTITION ( partition_col_name = partition_col_val [ , ... ] );
```

**Examples**
```sql
--Show partition:
SHOW PARTITIONS hudi_table;

--Drop partition：
ALTER TABLE hudi_table DROP PARTITION (dt='2021-12-09', hh='10');
```

:::note Slash-separated date partitioning and SHOW PARTITIONS
When a table is written with `hoodie.datasource.write.slash.separated.date.partitioning=true`, the
physical directory layout uses `yyyy/MM/dd` paths. `SHOW PARTITIONS` correctly handles this: it
returns partition values in the standard `col=yyyy-MM-dd` display format, normalizing the `/`
separators back to `-` for readability. See [Key Generation](key_generation.md#slash-separated-date-partitioning)
for details on configuring slash-separated partitioning.
:::

### Show and drop index

**Syntax**

```sql
-- Show Indexes
SHOW INDEXES FROM tableIdentifier;

-- Drop partition
DROP INDEX indexIdentifier ON tableIdentifier;
```

**Examples**
```sql
-- Show indexes
SHOW INDEXES FROM hudi_indexed_table;

-- Drop Index
DROP INDEX record_index ON hudi_indexed_table;
```

### Show create table

**Syntax**

```sql
SHOW CREATE TABLE tableIdentifier;
```

**Examples**
```sql
SHOW CREATE TABLE hudi_table;
```

### Caveats 

Hudi currently has the following limitations when using Spark SQL, to create/alter tables.

 - `ALTER TABLE ... RENAME TO ...` is not supported when using AWS Glue Data Catalog as hive metastore as Glue itself does
   not support table renames. 
 - A new Hudi table created by Spark SQL will by default set `hoodie.datasource.write.hive_style_partitioning=true`, for ease
     of use. This can be overridden using table properties.

## Flink SQL

### Create Catalog
The catalog helps to manage the SQL tables, the table can be shared among sessions if the catalog persists the table definitions.
For `hms` mode, the catalog also supplements the hive syncing options.

**Example**
```sql
CREATE CATALOG hoodie_catalog
  WITH (
    'type'='hudi',
    'catalog.path' = '${catalog default root path}',
    'hive.conf.dir' = '${directory where hive-site.xml is located}',
    'mode'='hms' -- supports 'dfs' mode that uses the DFS backend for table DDLs persistence
  );
```

#### Options
|  Option Name  | Required | Default | Remarks                                                                                                                                                                  |
|  -----------  | -------  | ------- |--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `catalog.path` | true | -- | Default path for the catalog's table storage, the path is used to infer the table path automatically, the default table path: `${catalog.path}/${db_name}/${table_name}` |
| `default-database` | false | default | default database name                                                                                                                                                    |
| `hive.conf.dir` | false | -- | The directory where hive-site.xml is located, only valid in `hms` mode                                                                                                   |
| `mode` | false | dfs | Supports `hms` mode that uses HMS to persist the table options                                                                                                           |
| `table.external` | false | false | Whether to create the external table, only valid in `hms` mode                                                                                                           |

### Create Table

You can create tables using standard FLINK SQL CREATE TABLE syntax, which supports partitioning and passing Flink options using WITH.

```sql
CREATE TABLE [IF NOT EXISTS] [catalog_name.][db_name.]table_name
  (
    { <physical_column_definition> 
    [ <table_constraint> ][ , ...n]
  )
  [COMMENT table_comment]
  [PARTITIONED BY (partition_column_name1, partition_column_name2, ...)]
  WITH (key1=val1, key2=val2, ...)
```

### Create non-partitioned table

Creating a non-partitioned table is as simple as creating a regular table.

```sql
-- create a Hudi table
CREATE TABLE hudi_table(
  id BIGINT,
  name STRING,
  price DOUBLE
)
WITH (
'connector' = 'hudi',
'path' = 'file:///tmp/hudi_table',
'table.type' = 'MERGE_ON_READ'
);
```

### Create partitioned table

The following is an example of creating a Flink partitioned table.

```sql 
CREATE TABLE hudi_table(
  id BIGINT,
  name STRING,
  dt STRING,
  hh STRING
)
PARTITIONED BY (`dt`)
WITH (
'connector' = 'hudi',
'path' = 'file:///tmp/hudi_table',
'table.type' = 'MERGE_ON_READ'
);
```

### Create table with record keys and ordering fields

The following is an example of creating a Flink table with record key and ordering field similarly to spark.

```sql
CREATE TABLE hudi_table(
  id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY NOT ENFORCED,
  name STRING,
  price DOUBLE,
  ts BIGINT
)
PARTITIONED BY (`dt`)
WITH (
'connector' = 'hudi',
'path' = 'file:///tmp/hudi_table',
'table.type' = 'MERGE_ON_READ',
'ordering.fields' = 'ts'
);
```

### Create Append-Only Table Without Primary Key

Hudi 1.2.0 supports creating a Flink table **without a `PRIMARY KEY`** for pure append workloads.
In this mode, set `write.operation` to `insert`; Hudi will not enforce record-level uniqueness and
the record-key and ordering fields are optional.

```sql
-- Append-only table: no PRIMARY KEY required
CREATE TABLE hudi_append_table (
  id      BIGINT,
  name    STRING,
  ts      BIGINT,
  city    STRING
)
PARTITIONED BY (`city`)
WITH (
  'connector'       = 'hudi',
  'path'            = 'file:///tmp/hudi_append_table',
  'table.type'      = 'COPY_ON_WRITE',
  'write.operation' = 'insert'
);

INSERT INTO hudi_append_table VALUES (1, 'Alice', 1695159649, 'sf'), (2, 'Bob', 1695091554, 'ny');
```

:::note
Without a primary key, Hudi uses auto-generated record keys and does **not** perform deduplication
or upsert merging. This is equivalent to `bulk_insert` semantics and is well suited for log/event
ingestion pipelines where every incoming row should be appended as-is.
If `write.operation` is any value other than `insert` and no `PRIMARY KEY` is defined, Hudi will
throw `"Primary key definition is missing"` at table creation time.
:::

### Create Table in Non-Blocking Concurrency Control Mode

The following is an example of creating a Flink table in [Non-Blocking Concurrency Control mode](concurrency_control.md#non-blocking-concurrency-control).

```sql
-- This is a datagen source that can generate records continuously
CREATE TABLE sourceT (
  uuid VARCHAR(20),
  name VARCHAR(10),
  age INT,
  ts TIMESTAMP(3),
  `partition` AS 'par1'
) WITH (
  'connector' = 'datagen',
  'rows-per-second' = '200'
);

-- pipeline1: by default, enable the compaction and cleaning services
CREATE TABLE t1 (
  uuid VARCHAR(20),
  name VARCHAR(10),
  age INT,
  ts TIMESTAMP(3),
  `partition` VARCHAR(20)
) WITH (
  'connector' = 'hudi',
  'path' = '/tmp/hudi-demo/t1',
  'table.type' = 'MERGE_ON_READ',
  'index.type' = 'BUCKET',
  'hoodie.write.concurrency.mode' = 'NON_BLOCKING_CONCURRENCY_CONTROL',
  'write.tasks' = '2'
);

-- pipeline2: disable the compaction and cleaning services manually
CREATE TABLE t1_2 (
  uuid VARCHAR(20),
  name VARCHAR(10),
  age INT,
  ts TIMESTAMP(3),
  `partition` VARCHAR(20)
) WITH (
  'connector' = 'hudi',
  'path' = '/tmp/hudi-demo/t1',
  'table.type' = 'MERGE_ON_READ',
  'index.type' = 'BUCKET',
  'hoodie.write.concurrency.mode' = 'NON_BLOCKING_CONCURRENCY_CONTROL',
  'write.tasks' = '2',
  'compaction.schedule.enabled' = 'false',
  'compaction.async.enabled' = 'false',
  'clean.async.enabled' = 'false'
);

-- Submit the pipelines
INSERT INTO t1
SELECT * FROM sourceT;

INSERT INTO t1_2
SELECT * FROM sourceT;

SELECT * FROM t1 LIMIT 20;
```

### Alter Table
```sql
ALTER TABLE tableA RENAME TO tableB;
```

### Setting Hudi configs

#### Using table options
You can configure hoodie configs in table options when creating a table. You can refer Flink specific hoodie configs [here](configurations.md#FLINK_SQL)
These configs will be applied to all the operations on that table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS tableName (
  colName1 colType1 PRIMARY KEY NOT ENFORCED,
  colName2 colType2,
  ...
)
WITH (
  'connector' = 'hudi',
  'path' = '${path}',
  ${hoodie.config.key1} = '${hoodie.config.value1}',
  ${hoodie.config.key2} = '${hoodie.config.value2}',
  ....
);

e.g.
CREATE TABLE hudi_table(
  id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY NOT ENFORCED,
  name STRING,
  price DOUBLE,
  ts BIGINT
)
PARTITIONED BY (`dt`)
WITH (
'connector' = 'hudi',
'path' = 'file:///tmp/hudi_table',
'table.type' = 'MERGE_ON_READ',
'ordering.fields' = 'ts',
'hoodie.cleaner.fileversions.retained' = '20',
'hoodie.keep.max.commits' = '20',
'hoodie.datasource.write.hive_style_partitioning' = 'true'
);
```
