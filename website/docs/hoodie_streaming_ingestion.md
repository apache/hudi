## Hudi Streamer

The `HoodieStreamer` utility (part of `hudi-utilities-slim-bundle` and `hudi-utilities-bundle`) provides ways to ingest
from different sources such as DFS or Kafka, with the following capabilities.

- Exactly once ingestion of new events from
  Kafka, [incremental imports](https://sqoop.apache.org/docs/1.4.2/SqoopUserGuide#_incremental_imports) from Sqoop or
  output of `HiveIncrementalPuller` or files under a DFS folder
- Support json, avro or a custom record types for the incoming data
- Manage checkpoints, rollback & recovery
- Leverage Avro schemas from DFS or Confluent [schema registry](https://github.com/confluentinc/schema-registry).
- Support for plugging in transformations

:::danger Important

The following classes were renamed and relocated to `org.apache.hudi.utilities.streamer` package.
- `DeltastreamerMultiWriterCkptUpdateFunc` is renamed to `StreamerMultiWriterCkptUpdateFunc`
- `DeltaSync` is renamed to `StreamSync`
- `HoodieDeltaStreamer` is renamed to `HoodieStreamer`
- `HoodieDeltaStreamerMetrics` is renamed to `HoodieStreamerMetrics`
- `HoodieMultiTableDeltaStreamer` is renamed to `HoodieMultiTableStreamer`

To maintain backward compatibility, the original classes are still present in the `org.apache.hudi.utilities.deltastreamer`
package, but have been deprecated.

  * --target-base-path
      base path for the target hoodie table. (Will be created if did not exist
      first time around. If exists, expected to be a hoodie table)
  * --target-table
      name of the target table
    --transformer-class
      A subclass or a list of subclasses of
      org.apache.hudi.utilities.transform.Transformer. Allows transforming raw
      source Dataset to a target Dataset (conforming to target schema) before
      writing. Default : Not set. E.g. -
      org.apache.hudi.utilities.transform.SqlQueryBasedTransformer (which
      allows a SQL query templated to be passed as a transformation function).
      Pass a comma-separated list of subclass names to chain the
      transformations. If there are two or more transformers using the same
      config keys and expect different values for those keys, then transformer
      can include an identifier. E.g. -
      tr1:org.apache.hudi.utilities.transform.SqlQueryBasedTransformer. Here
      the identifier tr1 can be used along with property key like
      `hoodie.streamer.transformer.sql.tr1` to identify properties related to
      the transformer. So effective value for
      `hoodie.streamer.transformer.sql` is determined by key
      `hoodie.streamer.transformer.sql.tr1` for this transformer. If
      identifier is used, it should be specified for all the transformers.
      Further the order in which transformer is applied is determined by the
      occurrence of transformer irrespective of the identifier used for the
      transformer. For example: In the configured value below tr2:org.apache.hudi.utilities.transform.SqlQueryBasedTransformer,tr1:org.apache.hudi.utilities.transform.SqlQueryBasedTransformer
      , tr2 is applied before tr1 based on order of occurrence.
```
</details>

The tool takes a hierarchically composed property file and has pluggable interfaces for extracting data, key generation and providing schema. Sample configs for ingesting from kafka and dfs are
provided under `hudi-utilities/src/test/resources/streamer-config`.

For e.g: once you have Confluent Kafka, Schema registry up & running, produce some test data using ([impressions.avro](https://docs.confluent.io/current/ksql/docs/tutorials/generate-custom-test-data) provided by schema-registry repo)

```java
[confluent-5.0.0]$ bin/ksql-datagen schema=../impressions.avro format=avro topic=impressions key=impressionid
```

and then ingest it as follows.

```java
[hoodie]$ spark-submit --class org.apache.hudi.utilities.streamer.HoodieStreamer `ls packaging/hudi-utilities-bundle/target/hudi-utilities-bundle-*.jar` \
  --props file://${PWD}/hudi-utilities/src/test/resources/streamer-config/kafka-source.properties \
  --schemaprovider-class org.apache.hudi.utilities.schema.SchemaRegistryProvider \
  --source-class org.apache.hudi.utilities.sources.AvroKafkaSource \
  --source-ordering-field impresssiontime \
  --target-base-path file:\/\/\/tmp/hudi-streamer-op \ 
  --target-table uber.impressions \
  --op BULK_INSERT
```

In some cases, you may want to migrate your existing table into Hudi beforehand. Please refer to [migration guide](/docs/migration_guide).

### Using `hudi-utilities` bundle jars

From 0.11.0 release, we start to provide a new `hudi-utilities-slim-bundle` which aims to exclude dependencies that can
cause conflicts and compatibility issues with different versions of Spark.

It is recommended to switch to `hudi-utilities-slim-bundle`, which should be used along with a Hudi Spark bundle
corresponding the Spark version used to make utilities work with Spark, e.g.,
`--packages org.apache.hudi:hudi-utilities-slim-bundle_2.12:0.13.0,org.apache.hudi:hudi-spark3.2-bundle_2.12:0.13.0`.

`hudi-utilities-bundle` remains as a legacy bundle jar to work with Spark 2.4 and 3.1.

### Concurrency Control

Using optimistic concurrency control (OCC) via Hudi Streamer requires the configs below to the properties file that can be passed to the
job. 

```properties
hoodie.write.concurrency.mode=optimistic_concurrency_control
hoodie.write.lock.provider=<lock-provider-classname>
hoodie.cleaner.policy.failed.writes=LAZY
```

As an example, adding the configs to `kafka-source.properties` file and passing them to Hudi Streamer will enable OCC.
A Hudi Streamer job can then be triggered as follows:

```java
[hoodie]$ spark-submit --class org.apache.hudi.utilities.streamer.HoodieStreamer `ls packaging/hudi-utilities-bundle/target/hudi-utilities-bundle-*.jar` \
  --props file://${PWD}/hudi-utilities/src/test/resources/streamer-config/kafka-source.properties \
  --schemaprovider-class org.apache.hudi.utilities.schema.SchemaRegistryProvider \
  --source-class org.apache.hudi.utilities.sources.AvroKafkaSource \
  --source-ordering-field impresssiontime \
  --target-base-path file:///tmp/hudi-streamer-op \ 
  --target-table uber.impressions \
  --op BULK_INSERT
```

Read more in depth about concurrency control in the [concurrency control concepts](/docs/concurrency_control) section

### Checkpointing

`HoodieStreamer` uses checkpoints to keep track of what data has been read already so it can resume without needing to reprocess all data.
When using a Kafka source, the checkpoint is the [Kafka Offset](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Offset+Management) 
When using a DFS source, the checkpoint is the 'last modified' timestamp of the latest file read.
Checkpoints are saved in the .hoodie commit file as `streamer.checkpoint.key`.

If you need to change the checkpoints for reprocessing or replaying data you can use the following options:

- `--checkpoint` will set `streamer.checkpoint.reset_key` in the commit file to overwrite the current checkpoint. Format of checkpoint depends on [KAFKA_CHECKPOINT_TYPE](/docs/configurations#hoodiestreamersourcekafkacheckpointtype). By default (for type `string`), checkpoint should be provided as: `topicName,0:offset0,1:offset1,2:offset2`. For type `timestamp`, checkpoint should be provided as long value of desired timestamp. For type `single_offset`, we assume that topic consists of a single partition, so checkpoint should be provided as long value of desired offset.
- `--source-limit` will set a maximum amount of data to read from the source. For DFS sources, this is max # of bytes read.
For Kafka, this is the max # of events to read.

### Transformers

`HoodieStreamer` supports custom transformation on records before writing to storage. This is done by supplying 
implementation of `org.apache.hudi.utilities.transform.Transformer` via `--transformer-class` option.

#### SQL Query Transformer
You can pass a SQL Query to be executed during write.

```scala
--transformer-class org.apache.hudi.utilities.transform.SqlQueryBasedTransformer
--hoodie-conf hoodie.streamer.transformer.sql=SELECT a.col1, a.col3, a.col4 FROM <SRC> a
```

#### SQL File Transformer
You can specify a File with a SQL script to be executed during write. The SQL file is configured with this hoodie property:
hoodie.streamer.transformer.sql.file

The query should reference the source as a table named "\<SRC\>"

The final sql statement result is used as the write payload.

Example Spark SQL Query:
```sql
CACHE TABLE tmp_personal_trips AS
SELECT * FROM <SRC> WHERE trip_type='personal_trips';

SELECT * FROM tmp_personal_trips;
```

#### Flattening Transformer
This transformer can flatten nested objects. It flattens the nested fields in the incoming records by prefixing
inner-fields with outer-field and _ in a nested fashion. Currently flattening of arrays is not supported.

An example schema may look something like the below where name is a nested field of StructType in the original source
```scala
age as intColumn,address as stringColumn,name.first as name_first,name.last as name_last, name.middle as name_middle
```

Set the config as:
```scala
--transformer-class org.apache.hudi.utilities.transform.FlatteningTransformer
```

#### Chained Transformer
If you wish to use multiple transformers together, you can use the Chained transformers to pass multiple to be executed sequentially.

Example below first flattens the incoming records and then does sql projection based on the query specified:
```scala
--transformer-class org.apache.hudi.utilities.transform.FlatteningTransformer,org.apache.hudi.utilities.transform.SqlQueryBasedTransformer   
--hoodie-conf hoodie.streamer.transformer.sql=SELECT a.col1, a.col3, a.col4 FROM <SRC> a
```

#### AWS DMS Transformer
This transformer is specific for AWS DMS data. It adds `Op` field with value `I` if the field is not present.

Set the config as:
```scala
--transformer-class org.apache.hudi.utilities.transform.AWSDmsTransformer
```

#### Custom Transformer Implementation
You can write your own custom transformer by extending [this class](https://github.com/apache/hudi/tree/master/hudi-utilities/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/utilities/transform)

### Schema Providers

By default, Spark will infer the schema of the source and use that inferred schema when writing to a table. If you need 
to explicitly define the schema you can use one of the following Schema Providers below.

#### Schema Registry Provider

You can obtain the latest schema from an online registry. You pass a URL to the registry and if needed, you can also 
pass userinfo and credentials in the url like: `https://foo:bar@schemaregistry.org` The credentials are then extracted 
and are set on the request as an Authorization Header.

When fetching schemas from a registry, you can specify both the source schema and the target schema separately.

| Config                                            | Description                                    | Example                            |
|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| hoodie.streamer.schemaprovider.registry.url       | The schema of the source you are reading from  | https://foo:bar@schemaregistry.org |
| hoodie.streamer.schemaprovider.registry.targetUrl | The schema of the target you are writing to    | https://foo:bar@schemaregistry.org |

The above configs are passed to Hudi Streamer spark-submit command like: 

```shell
--hoodie-conf hoodie.streamer.schemaprovider.registry.url=https://foo:bar@schemaregistry.org
```

There are other optional configs to work with schema registry provider such as SSL-store related configs, and supporting
custom transformation of schema returned by schema registry, e.g., converting the original json schema to avro schema
via `org.apache.hudi.utilities.schema.converter.JsonToAvroSchemaConverter`.

| Config                                                  | Description                                          | Example                                                                |
|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| schema.registry.ssl.truststore.location                 | SSL trust store location                             |                                                                        |

| schema.registry.ssl.key.password                        | SSL key password                                     |                                                                        |

#### JDBC Schema Provider

You can obtain the latest schema through a JDBC connection.

| Config                                                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Example                                                    |

The above configs are passed to Hudi Streamer spark-submit command like:
```--hoodie-conf hoodie.streamer.jdbcbasedschemaprovider.connection.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost/test?user=fred&password=secret```

#### File Based Schema Provider

You can use a .avsc file to define your schema. You can then point to this file on DFS as a schema provider.

| Config                                            | Description                                   | Example                                                                                                                                       |
|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| hoodie.streamer.schemaprovider.source.schema.file | The schema of the source you are reading from | [example schema file](https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/a8fb69656f522648233f0310ca3756188d954281/docker/demo/config/test-suite/source.avsc) |
| hoodie.streamer.schemaprovider.target.schema.file | The schema of the target you are writing to   | [example schema file](https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/a8fb69656f522648233f0310ca3756188d954281/docker/demo/config/test-suite/target.avsc) |

#### Hive Schema Provider

You can use hive tables to fetch source and target schema. 

| Config                                                     | Description                                            |
|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| hoodie.streamer.schemaprovider.source.schema.hive.database | Hive database from where source schema can be fetched  |
| hoodie.streamer.schemaprovider.source.schema.hive.table    | Hive table from where source schema can be fetched     |
| hoodie.streamer.schemaprovider.target.schema.hive.database | Hive database from where target schema can be fetched  |
| hoodie.streamer.schemaprovider.target.schema.hive.table    | Hive table from where target schema can be fetched     |


#### Schema Provider with Post Processor
The SchemaProviderWithPostProcessor, will extract the schema from one of the previously mentioned Schema Providers and 
then will apply a post processor to change the schema before it is used. You can write your own post processor by extending 
this class: https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/master/hudi-utilities/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/utilities/schema/SchemaPostProcessor.java

### Sources

Hoodie Streamer can read data from a wide variety of sources. The following are a list of supported sources:

#### Distributed File System (DFS)
See the storage configurations page to see some examples of DFS applications Hudi can read from. The following are the 
supported file formats Hudi can read/write with on DFS Sources. (Note: you can still use Spark/Flink readers to read from 
other formats and then write data as Hudi format.)

- CSV
- AVRO
- JSON
- PARQUET
- ORC
- HUDI

For DFS sources the following behaviors are expected:

- For JSON DFS source, you always need to set a schema. If the target Hudi table follows the same schema as from the source file, you just need to set the source schema. If not, you need to set schemas for both source and target. 
- `HoodieStreamer` reads the files under the source base path (`hoodie.streamer.source.dfs.root`) directly, and it won't use the partition paths under this base path as fields of the dataset. Detailed examples can be found [here](https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/5485).

#### Kafka
Hudi can read directly from Kafka clusters. See more details on `HoodieStreamer` to learn how to setup streaming 
ingestion with exactly once semantics, checkpointing, and plugin transformations. The following formats are supported 
when reading data from Kafka:

- AVRO: `org.apache.hudi.utilities.sources.AvroKafkaSource`
- JSON: `org.apache.hudi.utilities.sources.JsonKafkaSource`
- Proto: `org.apache.hudi.utilities.sources.ProtoKafkaSource`

Check out [Kafka source config](https://hudi.apache.org/docs/configurations#Kafka-Source-Configs) for more details.

#### Pulsar

`HoodieStreamer` also supports ingesting from Apache Pulsar via `org.apache.hudi.utilities.sources.PulsarSource`.
Check out [Pulsar source config](https://hudi.apache.org/docs/configurations#Pulsar-Source-Configs) for more details.

#### Cloud storage event sources
AWS S3 storage provides an event notification service which will post notifications when certain events happen in your S3 bucket: 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/NotificationHowTo.html
AWS will put these events in a Simple Queue Service (SQS). Apache Hudi provides `S3EventsSource`
and `S3EventsHoodieIncrSource` that can read from SQS to trigger/processing of new or changed data as soon as it is
available on S3. Check out [S3 source configs](https://hudi.apache.org/docs/configurations#S3-Source-Configs) for more details.

Similar to S3 event source, Google Cloud Storage (GCS) event source is also supported via `GcsEventsSource` and
`GcsEventsHoodieIncrSource`. Check out [GCS events source configs](https://hudi.apache.org/docs/configurations#GCS-Events-Source-Configs) for more details.

##### AWS Setup
1. Enable S3 Event Notifications https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/NotificationHowTo.html
2. Download the aws-java-sdk-sqs jar. 
3. Find the queue URL and Region to set these configurations:
   1. hoodie.streamer.s3.source.queue.url=https://sqs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/queue/url
   2. hoodie.streamer.s3.source.queue.region=us-west-2 
4. Start the `S3EventsSource` and `S3EventsHoodieIncrSource` using the `HoodieStreamer` utility as shown in sample commands below:

Insert code sample from this blog: https://hudi.apache.org/blog/2021/08/23/s3-events-source/#configuration-and-setup

#### JDBC Source
Hudi can read from a JDBC source with a full fetch of a table, or Hudi can even read incrementally with checkpointing from a JDBC source.

#### SQL Sources

SQL Source `org.apache.hudi.utilities.sources.SqlSource` reads from any table, used mainly for backfill jobs which will process specific partition dates. 
This won't update the streamer.checkpoint.key to the processed commit, instead it will fetch the latest successful 
checkpoint key and set that value as this backfill commits checkpoint so that it won't interrupt the regular incremental 
processing. To fetch and use the latest incremental checkpoint, you need to also set this hoodie_conf for Hudi Streamer 
jobs: `hoodie.write.meta.key.prefixes = 'streamer.checkpoint.key'`

Spark SQL should be configured using this hoodie config:
`hoodie.streamer.source.sql.sql.query = 'select * from source_table'`

Using `org.apache.hudi.utilities.sources.SqlFileBasedSource` allows setting the SQL queries in a file to read from any
table. SQL file path should be configured using this hoodie config:
`hoodie.streamer.source.sql.file = 'hdfs://xxx/source.sql'`

### Error Table

`HoodieStreamer` supports segregating error records into a separate table called "Error table" alongside with the 
target data table. This allows easy integration with dead-letter queues (DLQ). Error Table is supported with 
user-provided subclass of `org.apache.hudi.utilities.streamer.BaseErrorTableWriter` supplied via
config `hoodie.errortable.write.class`. Check out more in `org.apache.hudi.config.HoodieErrorTableConfig`.

### Termination Strategy

Users can configure a post-write termination strategy under `continuous` mode if need be. For instance,
users can configure graceful shutdown if there is no new data from the configured source for 5 consecutive times. 
Here is the interface for the termination strategy.

```java
/**
 * Post write termination strategy for deltastreamer in continuous mode.
 */
public interface PostWriteTerminationStrategy {

  /**
   * Returns whether HoodieStreamer needs to be shutdown.
   * @param scheduledCompactionInstantAndWriteStatuses optional pair of scheduled compaction instant and write statuses.
   * @return true if HoodieStreamer has to be shutdown. false otherwise.
   */
  boolean shouldShutdown(Option<Pair<Option<String>, JavaRDD<WriteStatus>>> scheduledCompactionInstantAndWriteStatuses);

}
```

Also, this might help in bootstrapping a new table. Instead of doing one bulk load or bulk_insert leveraging a large
cluster for a large input of data, one could start `HoodieStreamer` on the `continuous` mode and add a shutdown strategy
to terminate, once all data has been bootstrapped. This way, each batch could be smaller and may not need a large
cluster to bootstrap data. There is a concrete implementation provided out-of-the-box: [NoNewDataTerminationStrategy](https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/0d0a4152cfd362185066519ae926ac4513c7a152/hudi-utilities/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/utilities/deltastreamer/NoNewDataTerminationStrategy.java).
Users can feel free to implement their own strategy as they see fit.

### Dynamic configuration updates

When Hoodie Streamer is running in `continuous` mode, the properties can be refreshed/updated before each sync calls.
Interested users can implement `org.apache.hudi.utilities.deltastreamer.ConfigurationHotUpdateStrategy` to leverage this.

## MultiTableStreamer

`HoodieMultiTableStreamer`, an extension of `HoodieStreamer`, facilitates the simultaneous ingestion of multiple tables into Hudi datasets. At present, it supports the sequential ingestion of tables and accommodates both COPY_ON_WRITE and MERGE_ON_READ storage types. The command line parameters for `HoodieMultiTableStreamer` largely mirror those of `HoodieStreamer`, with the notable difference being the necessity to supply table-specific configurations in separate files in a dedicated config folder. New command line options have been introduced to support this functionality:

```java
  * --config-folder
    the path to the folder which contains all the table wise config files
    --base-path-prefix
    this is added to enable users to create all the hudi datasets for related tables under one path in FS. The datasets are then created under the path - <base_path_prefix>/<database>/<table_to_be_ingested>. However you can override the paths for every table by setting the property hoodie.streamer.ingestion.targetBasePath
```

The following properties are needed to be set properly to ingest data using `HoodieMultiTableStreamer`.

```java
hoodie.streamer.ingestion.tablesToBeIngested
  comma separated names of tables to be ingested in the format <database>.<table>, for example db1.table1,db1.table2
hoodie.streamer.ingestion.targetBasePath
  if you wish to ingest a particular table in a separate path, you can mention that path here
hoodie.streamer.ingestion.<database>.<table>.configFile
  path to the config file in dedicated config folder which contains table overridden properties for the particular table to be ingested.
```

Sample config files for table wise overridden properties can be found
under `hudi-utilities/src/test/resources/streamer-config`. The command to run `HoodieMultiTableStreamer` is also similar
to how you run `HoodieStreamer`.

```java
[hoodie]$ spark-submit --class org.apache.hudi.utilities.streamer.HoodieMultiTableStreamer `ls packaging/hudi-utilities-bundle/target/hudi-utilities-bundle-*.jar` \
  --props file://${PWD}/hudi-utilities/src/test/resources/streamer-config/kafka-source.properties \
  --config-folder file://tmp/hudi-ingestion-config \
  --schemaprovider-class org.apache.hudi.utilities.schema.SchemaRegistryProvider \
  --source-class org.apache.hudi.utilities.sources.AvroKafkaSource \
  --source-ordering-field impresssiontime \
  --base-path-prefix file:\/\/\/tmp/hudi-streamer-op \ 
  --target-table uber.impressions \
  --op BULK_INSERT
```
