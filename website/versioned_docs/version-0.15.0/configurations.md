This page covers the different ways of configuring your job to write/read Hudi tables. At a high level, you can control behaviour at few levels.

- [**Hudi Table Config**](#TABLE_CONFIG): Basic Hudi Table configuration parameters.
- [**Environment Config**](#ENVIRONMENT_CONFIG): Hudi supports passing configurations via a configuration file `hudi-defaults.conf` in which each line consists of a key and a value separated by whitespace or = sign. For example:
```
hoodie.datasource.hive_sync.mode               jdbc
hoodie.datasource.hive_sync.jdbcurl            jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000
hoodie.datasource.hive_sync.support_timestamp  false
```
It helps to have a central configuration file for your common cross job configurations/tunings, so all the jobs on your cluster can utilize it. It also works with Spark SQL DML/DDL, and helps avoid having to pass configs inside the SQL statements.

By default, Hudi would load the configuration file under `/etc/hudi/conf` directory. You can specify a different configuration directory location by setting the `HUDI_CONF_DIR` environment variable.
- [**Spark Datasource Configs**](#SPARK_DATASOURCE): These configs control the Hudi Spark Datasource, providing ability to define keys/partitioning, pick out the write operation, specify how to merge records or choosing query type to read.
- [**Flink Sql Configs**](#FLINK_SQL): These configs control the Hudi Flink SQL source/sink connectors, providing ability to define record keys, pick out the write operation, specify how to merge records, enable/disable asynchronous compaction or choosing query type to read.
- [**Write Client Configs**](#WRITE_CLIENT): Internally, the Hudi datasource uses a RDD based HoodieWriteClient API to actually perform writes to storage. These configs provide deep control over lower level aspects like file sizing, compression, parallelism, compaction, write schema, cleaning etc. Although Hudi provides sane defaults, from time-time these configs may need to be tweaked to optimize for specific workloads.
- [**Reader Configs**](#READER): Please fill in the description for Config Group Name: Reader Configs
- [**Metastore and Catalog Sync Configs**](#META_SYNC): Configurations used by the Hudi to sync metadata to external metastores and catalogs.
- [**Metrics Configs**](#METRICS): These set of configs are used to enable monitoring and reporting of key Hudi stats and metrics.
- [**Record Payload Config**](#RECORD_PAYLOAD): This is the lowest level of customization offered by Hudi. Record payloads define how to produce new values to upsert based on incoming new record and stored old record. Hudi provides default implementations such as OverwriteWithLatestAvroPayload which simply update table with the latest/last-written record. This can be overridden to a custom class extending HoodieRecordPayload class, on both datasource and WriteClient levels.
- [**Kafka Connect Configs**](#KAFKA_CONNECT): These set of configs are used for Kafka Connect Sink Connector for writing Hudi Tables
- [**Amazon Web Services Configs**](#AWS): Configurations specific to Amazon Web Services.
- [**Hudi Streamer Configs**](#HUDI_STREAMER): These set of configs are used for Hudi Streamer utility which provides the way to ingest from different sources such as DFS or Kafka.

## Externalized Config File
Instead of directly passing configuration settings to every Hudi job, you can also centrally set them in a configuration
file `hudi-defaults.conf`. By default, Hudi would load the configuration file under `/etc/hudi/conf` directory. You can
specify a different configuration directory location by setting the `HUDI_CONF_DIR` environment variable. This can be
useful for uniformly enforcing repeated configs (like Hive sync or write/index tuning), across your entire data lake.

## Hudi Table Config {#TABLE_CONFIG}
Basic Hudi Table configuration parameters.


### Hudi Table Basic Configs {#Hudi-Table-Basic-Configs}
Configurations of the Hudi Table like type of ingestion, storage formats, hive table name etc. Configurations are loaded from hoodie.properties, these properties are usually set during initializing a path as hoodie base path and never changes during the lifetime of a hoodie table.

This config allows users to have different ways of handling this situation. The valid values are [FAIL, BLOCK, USE_TRANSITION_TIME]: Use `FAIL` to throw an exception when hollow commit is detected. This is helpful when hollow commits are not expected. Use `BLOCK` to block processing commits from going beyond the hollow ones. This fits the case where waiting for hollow commits to finish is acceptable. Use `USE_TRANSITION_TIME` (experimental) to query commits in range by state transition time (completion time), instead of commit time (start time). Using this mode will result in `begin.instanttime` and `end.instanttime` using `stateTransitionTime`  instead of the instant's commit time.<br />`Config Param: INCREMENTAL_READ_HANDLE_HOLLOW_COMMIT`<br />`Since Version: 0.14.0` |

### Write Options {#Write-Options}
You can pass down any of the WriteClient level configs directly using `options()` or `option(k,v)` methods.

```java
inputDF.write()
.format("org.apache.hudi")
.options(clientOpts) // any of the Hudi client opts can be passed in as well
.option(DataSourceWriteOptions.RECORDKEY_FIELD_OPT_KEY(), "_row_key")
.option(DataSourceWriteOptions.PARTITIONPATH_FIELD_OPT_KEY(), "partition")
.option(DataSourceWriteOptions.PRECOMBINE_FIELD_OPT_KEY(), "timestamp")
.option(HoodieWriteConfig.TABLE_NAME, tableName)
.mode(SaveMode.Append)
.save(basePath);
```

Options useful for writing tables via `write.format.option(...)`

There is no precombine (if there are duplicates within the same batch being ingested, same dups will be ingested) with bulk_insert and insert and there is no index look up as well. If you may use INSERT_INTO for mutable dataset, then you may have to set this config value to "upsert".

## Write Client Configs {#WRITE_CLIENT}
Internally, the Hudi datasource uses a RDD based HoodieWriteClient API to actually perform writes to storage. These configs provide deep control over lower level aspects like file sizing, compression, parallelism, compaction, write schema, cleaning etc. Although Hudi provides sane defaults, from time-time these configs may need to be tweaked to optimize for specific workloads.


### Common Configurations {#Common-Configurations}
The following set of configurations are common across Hudi.



[**Basic Configs**](#Common-Configurations-basic-configs)


| Config Name                         | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

This config allows users to have different ways of handling this situation. The valid values are [FAIL, BLOCK, USE_TRANSITION_TIME]: Use `FAIL` to throw an exception when hollow commit is detected. This is helpful when hollow commits are not expected. Use `BLOCK` to block processing commits from going beyond the hollow ones. This fits the case where waiting for hollow commits to finish is acceptable. Use `USE_TRANSITION_TIME` (experimental) to query commits in range by state transition time (completion time), instead of commit time (start time). Using this mode will result in `begin.instanttime` and `end.instanttime` using `stateTransitionTime`  instead of the instant's commit time.<br />`Config Param: INCREMENTAL_READ_HANDLE_HOLLOW_COMMIT`<br />`Since Version: 0.14.0` |

This is the number of entries to be stored in the bloom filter. The rationale for the default: Assume the maxParquetFileSize is 128MB and averageRecordSize is 1kb and hence we approx a total of 130K records in a file. The default (60000) is roughly half of this approximation. Warning: Setting this very low, will generate a lot of false positives and index lookup will have to scan a lot more files than it has to and setting this to a very high number will increase the size every base file linearly (roughly 4KB for every 50000 entries).

The file deletion also happens after merging small archived files into larger ones if enabled. This config limits the Spark parallelism for deleting files in both cases, i.e., parallelism of deleting files does not go above the configured value and the parallelism is the number of files to delete if smaller than the configured value.  If you see that the file deletion in archival operation is slow because of the limited parallelism, you can increase this to tune the performance.<br />`Config Param: DELETE_ARCHIVED_INSTANT_PARALLELISM_VALUE` |

### Bootstrap Configs {#Bootstrap-Configs}
Configurations that control how you want to bootstrap your existing tables for the first time into hudi. The bootstrap operation can flexibly avoid copying data over before you can use Hudi and support running the existing  writers and new hudi writers in parallel, to validate the migration.

METADATA_ONLY(default): In this mode, the full record data is not copied into Hudi therefore it avoids full cost of rewriting the dataset. Instead, 'skeleton' files containing just the corresponding metadata columns are added to the Hudi table.

This config limits the number of parallelism. We pick the configured parallelism if the number of table partitions is larger than this configured value. The parallelism is assigned to the number of table partitions if it is smaller than the configured value. For full-record bootstrap, i.e., BULK_INSERT operation of the records, this configured value is passed as the BULK_INSERT shuffle parallelism (`hoodie.bulkinsert.shuffle.parallelism`), determining the BULK_INSERT write behavior. If you see that the bootstrap is slow due to the limited parallelism, you can increase this.<br />`Config Param: PARALLELISM_VALUE`<br />`Since Version: 0.6.0`                                                                                                  |

Deriving the cleaning plan is parallelized at the table partition level, i.e., each table partition is processed by one Spark task to figure out the files to clean. The cleaner picks the configured parallelism if the number of table partitions is larger than this configured value. The parallelism is assigned to the number of table partitions if it is smaller than the configured value. The clean execution, i.e., the file deletion, is parallelized at file level, which is the unit of Spark task distribution. Similarly, the actual parallelism cannot exceed the configured value if the number of files is larger.

The cleaner service deletes older file slices files to re-claim space. Long running query plans may often refer to older file slices and will break if those are cleaned, before the query has had a chance to run. So, it is good to make sure that the data is retained for more than the maximum query execution time. By default, the cleaning policy is determined based on one of the following configs explicitly set by the user (at most one of them can be set; otherwise, KEEP_LATEST_COMMITS cleaning policy is used).     KEEP_LATEST_FILE_VERSIONS: keeps the last N versions of the file slices written; used when "hoodie.cleaner.fileversions.retained" is explicitly set only.     KEEP_LATEST_COMMITS(default): keeps the file slices written by the last N commits; used when "hoodie.cleaner.commits.retained" is explicitly set only.     KEEP_LATEST_BY_HOURS: keeps the file slices written in the last N hours based on the commit time; used when "hoodie.cleaner.hours.retained" is explicitly set only.<br />`Config Param: CLEANER_POLICY` |

This configuration controls the type of a strategy to use for building the space-filling curves, tackling specifically how the Strings are ordered based on the curve. Since we truncate the String to 8 bytes for ordering, there are two issues: (1) it can lead to poor aggregation effect, (2) the truncation of String longer than 8 bytes loses the precision, if the Strings are different but the 8-byte prefix is the same. The boundary-based interleaved index method ("SAMPLE") has better generalization, solving the two problems above, but is slower than direct method ("DIRECT"). User should benchmark the write and query performance before tweaking this in production, if this is actually a problem. Please refer to RFC-28 for more details.     DIRECT(default): This strategy builds the spatial curve in full, filling in all of the individual points corresponding to each individual record, which requires less compute.     SAMPLE: This strategy leverages boundary-base interleaved index method (described in more details in Amazon DynamoDB blog https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/database/tag/z-order/) and produces a better layout compared to DIRECT strategy.

Before 0.13.0 release, if users do not configure it, Hudi would use 200 as the default shuffle parallelism. From 0.13.0 onwards Hudi by default automatically uses the parallelism deduced by Spark based on the source data or the parallelism based on the logical plan for row writer. If the shuffle parallelism is explicitly configured by the user, the user-configured parallelism is used in defining the actual parallelism. If you observe small files from the bulk insert operation, we suggest configuring this shuffle parallelism explicitly, so that the parallelism is around total_input_data_size/120MB.<br />`Config Param: BULKINSERT_PARALLELISM_VALUE`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

NONE(default): No sorting. Fastest and matches `spark.write.parquet()` in number of files and overhead.     GLOBAL_SORT: This ensures best file sizes, with lowest memory overhead at cost of sorting.     PARTITION_SORT: Strikes a balance by only sorting within a Spark RDD partition, still keeping the memory overhead of writing low. File sizing is not as good as GLOBAL_SORT.     PARTITION_PATH_REPARTITION: This ensures that the data for a single physical partition in the table is written by the same Spark executor. This should only be used when input data is evenly distributed across different partition paths. If data is skewed (most records are intended for a handful of partition paths among all) then this can cause an imbalance among Spark executors.     PARTITION_PATH_REPARTITION_AND_SORT: This ensures that the data for a single physical partition in the table is written by the same Spark executor. This should only be used when input data is evenly distributed across different partition paths. Compared to PARTITION_PATH_REPARTITION, this sort mode does an additional step of sorting the records based on the partition path within a single Spark partition, given that data for multiple physical partitions can be sent to the same Spark partition and executor. If data is skewed (most records are intended for a handful of partition paths among all) then this can cause an imbalance among Spark executors.<br />`Config Param: BULK_INSERT_SORT_MODE`                                                                          |

Please use `hoodie.datasource.write.keygenerator.class` instead. org.apache.hudi.keygen.constant.KeyGeneratorType: Key generator type, indicating the key generator class to use, that implements `org.apache.hudi.keygen.KeyGenerator`.     SIMPLE(default): Simple key generator, which takes names of fields to be used for recordKey and partitionPath as configs.     COMPLEX: Complex key generator, which takes names of fields to be used for recordKey and partitionPath as configs.     TIMESTAMP: Timestamp-based key generator, that relies on timestamps for partitioning field. Still picks record key by name.     CUSTOM: This is a generic implementation type of KeyGenerator where users can configure record key as a single field or  a combination of fields. Similarly partition path can be configured to have multiple fields or only one field.  This KeyGenerator expects value for prop "hoodie.datasource.write.partitionpath.field" in a specific format.  For example:  properties.put("hoodie.datasource.write.partitionpath.field", "field1:PartitionKeyType1,field2:PartitionKeyType2").     NON_PARTITION: Simple Key generator for non-partitioned tables.

Inserts can shuffle data before writing to tune file sizes and optimize the storage layout. Before 0.13.0 release, if users do not configure it, Hudi would use 200 as the default shuffle parallelism. From 0.13.0 onwards Hudi by default automatically uses the parallelism deduced by Spark based on the source data. If the shuffle parallelism is explicitly configured by the user, the user-configured parallelism is used in defining the actual parallelism. If you observe small files from the insert operation, we suggest configuring this shuffle parallelism explicitly, so that the parallelism is around total_input_data_size/120MB.<br />`Config Param: INSERT_PARALLELISM_VALUE`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Upserts can shuffle data to perform index lookups, file sizing, bin packing records optimally into file groups. Before 0.13.0 release, if users do not configure it, Hudi would use 200 as the default shuffle parallelism. From 0.13.0 onwards Hudi by default automatically uses the parallelism deduced by Spark based on the source data. If the shuffle parallelism is explicitly configured by the user, the user-configured parallelism is used in defining the actual parallelism.

BLOCKING_WAIT(default): The slowest of the available wait strategies. However, it is the most conservative with the respect to CPU usage and will give the most consistent behaviour across the widest variety of deployment options.     SLEEPING_WAIT: Like the `BLOCKING_WAIT` strategy, it attempts to be conservative with CPU usage by using a simple busy wait loop. The difference is that the `SLEEPING_WAIT` strategy uses a call to `LockSupport.parkNanos(1)` in the middle of the loop. On a typical Linux system this will pause the thread for around 60µs.     YIELDING_WAIT: The `YIELDING_WAIT` strategy is one of two wait strategy that can be used in low-latency systems. It is designed for cases where there is an opportunity to burn CPU cycles with the goal of improving latency. The `YIELDING_WAIT` strategy will busy spin, waiting for the sequence to increment to the appropriate value. Inside the body of the loop `Thread#yield()` will be called allowing other queued threads to run. This is the recommended wait strategy when you need very high performance, and the number of `EventHandler` threads is lower than the total number of logical cores, such as when hyper-threading is enabled.     BUSY_SPIN_WAIT: The `BUSY_SPIN_WAIT` strategy is the highest performing wait strategy. Like the `YIELDING_WAIT` strategy, it can be used in low-latency systems, but puts the highest constraints on the deployment environment.<br />`Config Param: WRITE_EXECUTOR_DISRUPTOR_WAIT_STRATEGY`<br />`Since Version: 0.13.0` |

The executor orchestrates concurrent producers and consumers communicating through a message queue.     BOUNDED_IN_MEMORY: Executor which orchestrates concurrent producers and consumers communicating through a bounded in-memory message queue using LinkedBlockingQueue. This queue will use extra lock to balance producers and consumers.     DISRUPTOR: Executor which orchestrates concurrent producers and consumers communicating through disruptor as a lock free message queue to gain better writing performance. Although DisruptorExecutor is still an experimental feature.     SIMPLE(default): Executor with no inner message queue and no inner lock. Consuming and writing records from iterator directly. The advantage is that there is no need for additional memory and cpu resources due to lock or multithreading. The disadvantage is that the executor is a single-write-single-read model, cannot support functions such as speed limit and can not de-couple the network read (shuffle read) and network write (writing objects/files to storage) anymore.<br />`Config Param: WRITE_EXECUTOR_TYPE`<br />`Since Version: 0.13.0`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

TIMELINE_SERVER_BASED(default): Marker operations are all handled at the timeline service which serves as a proxy.

| [hoodie.index.type](#hoodieindextype) | (N/A)   | org.apache.hudi.index.HoodieIndex$IndexType: Determines how input records are indexed, i.e., looked up based on the key for the location in the existing table. Default is SIMPLE on Spark engine, and INMEMORY on Flink and Java engines.     HBASE: uses an external managed Apache HBase table to store record key to location mapping. HBase index is a global index, enforcing key uniqueness across all partitions in the table.     INMEMORY: Uses in-memory hashmap in Spark and Java engine and Flink in-memory state in Flink for indexing.     BLOOM: Employs bloom filters built out of the record keys, optionally also pruning candidate files using record key ranges. Key uniqueness is enforced inside partitions.     GLOBAL_BLOOM: Employs bloom filters built out of the record keys, optionally also pruning candidate files using record key ranges. Key uniqueness is enforced across all partitions in the table.      SIMPLE: Performs a lean join of the incoming update/delete records against keys extracted from the table on storage.Key uniqueness is enforced inside partitions.     GLOBAL_SIMPLE: Performs a lean join of the incoming update/delete records against keys extracted from the table on storage.Key uniqueness is enforced across all partitions in the table.     BUCKET: locates the file group containing the record fast by using bucket hashing, particularly beneficial in large scale. Use `hoodie.index.bucket.engine` to choose bucket engine type, i.e., how buckets are generated.     FLINK_STATE: Internal Config for indexing based on Flink state.     RECORD_INDEX: Index which saves the record key to location mappings in the HUDI Metadata Table. Record index is a global index, enforcing key uniqueness across all partitions in the table. Supports sharding to achieve very high scale.<br />`Config Param: INDEX_TYPE` |

## Record Payload Config {#RECORD_PAYLOAD}
This is the lowest level of customization offered by Hudi. Record payloads define how to produce new values to upsert based on incoming new record and stored old record. Hudi provides default implementations such as OverwriteWithLatestAvroPayload which simply update table with the latest/last-written record. This can be overridden to a custom class extending HoodieRecordPayload class, on both datasource and WriteClient levels.


### Payload Configurations {#Payload-Configurations}
Payload related configs, that can be leveraged to control merges based on specific business fields in the data.
