:::note 
Many cloud object storage systems like [Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/s3/) allow you to set
lifecycle policies, such as [S3 Lifecycle](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html),
to manage objects. One of the policies is related to object expiration. If your organisation has configured such policies, 
then please ensure to exclude (or have a longer expiry period) for Hudi tables.
