The following describes the general file layout structure for Apache Hudi. Please refer the **[tech spec](https://hudi.apache.org/tech-specs#file-layout-hierarchy)** for a more detailed description of the file layouts.
* Hudi organizes data tables into a directory structure under a base path on a distributed file system
* Tables are broken up into partitions
* Within each partition, files are organized into file groups, uniquely identified by a file ID
* Each file group contains several file slices 
* Each slice contains a base file (*.parquet/*.orc) (defined by the config - [hoodie.table.base.file.format](https://hudi.apache.org/docs/next/configurations/#hoodietablebasefileformat) ) produced at a certain commit/compaction instant time, along with set of log files (*.log.*) that contain inserts/updates to the base file since the base file was produced. 

Hudi adopts Multiversion Concurrency Control (MVCC), where [compaction](/docs/next/compaction) action merges logs and base files to produce new 
file slices and [cleaning](/docs/next/hoodie_cleaner) action gets rid of unused/older file slices to reclaim space on the file system.
