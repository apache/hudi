## Become a Committer

We are always looking for strong contributors, who can become [committers](https://www.apache.org/dev/committers) on the project. 
Committers are chosen by a majority vote of the Apache Hudi [PMC](https://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works#pmc-members), after a discussion on their candidacy based on the following criteria (not exclusive/comprehensive).
