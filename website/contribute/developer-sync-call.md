The Hudi community is hosting weekly developer sync calls. This is a weekly planning session for developers to review 
progress, address blockers, and coordinate tasks for the upcoming open source release.

Join us for the latest development in the community, tips to start contributing, and more!

## Agenda

This is a recurring weekly meeting to plan and track active work for the upcoming open source release. Each session will focus on:

* **Progress Review** – Status updates on active work items
* **Prioritization** – Identifying key tasks for the coming week
* **Blocker Resolution** – Discuss and address any issues
* **Coordination** – Align contributors on responsibilities and timelines
* **Timeline Check** – Confirm we remain on track for the planned release date
* **Open floor** - To discuss any open items or topics not covered in the agenda

Our goal each week is to leave with a clear, updated plan and alignment across all contributors.
