## Introduction
ACID transactions and data lakes represent two critical components of modern data management. ACID, an acronym for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability, defines a set of properties guaranteeing data integrity and reliability in database systems. Data lakes, on the other hand, are vast repositories storing raw data in its native format for analysis and insights. While traditionally data lakes lacked ACID compliance, their growing importance in business-critical operations has necessitated the integration of these transactional guarantees. In this article, you will discover how the ACID capabilities within Apache Hudi open table format upgrades data lakes into data lakehouses.

## The Need for ACID Transactions in Data Lakes
The traditional data lake, characterized by its schema-on-read approach and focus on batch processing, is undergoing a significant transformation. The increasing complexity of data, driven by factors like IoT, social media, and cloud applications, demands more sophisticated data management capabilities. In addition, the imperative to derive insights in real-time has become a business critical requirement. These evolving data requirements necessitate a paradigm shift towards more structured and transactional data processing.

* Increasing Data Complexity: Data is becoming increasingly diverse, unstructured, and voluminous. This complexity makes it challenging to ensure data consistency and integrity without ACID transactions.
* Need for Real-Time Data Processing: As businesses demand faster insights, data lakes are evolving into real-time data platforms. ACID transactions are essential for handling concurrent updates and ensuring data consistency in such dynamic environments. 
 
### Benefits of ACID Transactions in Data Lakes
ACID transactions offer a robust foundation for data management, providing several critical benefits:

* Data Integrity: ACID guarantees that data modifications are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable. This ensures that data remains accurate and reliable, even in the face of system failures or concurrent updates.   
* Error Handling: By treating data operations as transactions, ACID enables efficient error handling. If a transaction fails, the system can roll back changes, preventing data corruption.
* Concurrency Control: ACID transactions effectively manage concurrent access to data, preventing data inconsistencies and race conditions. This is crucial for real-time data processing scenarios.   

### Use Cases
ACID transactions in data lakes can be applied to a wide range of use cases:

* Financial Services: Real-time fraud detection, risk assessment, and trade execution require ACID transactions to ensure data accuracy and consistency.
* Retail: Inventory management, pricing optimization, and customer recommendation systems benefit from ACID transactions to maintain data integrity and support real-time updates.
* Healthcare: Patient data management, clinical trials, and real-time patient monitoring demand ACID transactions for data accuracy and security.
* IoT: Processing and analyzing sensor data in real-time requires ACID transactions to handle high volumes of data and ensure data consistency.
* Supply Chain: Inventory management, order processing, and logistics optimization can benefit from ACID transactions to improve efficiency and accuracy.

By incorporating ACID transactions into data lakes, organizations can enhance data quality, improve operational efficiency, and unlock new insights from their data.

## Implementing ACID transactions in data lakes
Hudi offers ACID transaction capabilities through a combination of features. At its core, Hudi maintains a timeline of all actions performed on a table, ensuring data consistency and enabling efficient read queries. By leveraging instant timestamps and atomic commit publishing, Hudi guarantees atomicity. Isolation is achieved through careful management of concurrent writes and read isolation levels. Durability is ensured by persisting data changes to storage and maintaining a record of the transaction in the timeline. While Hudi inherently provides a strong foundation for ACID transactions, fine-tuning configurations like write concurrency control, read isolation levels, and error handling is crucial for optimal performance and data integrity in specific use cases.

There are 2 critical settings to enable ACID transactions within Apache Hudi:
* Picking a concurrency mode - As of Apache Hudi 0.15.0, the stable solution is to use optimistic concurrency control.
* Pick a lock provider - As of Apache Hudi 0.15.0, itâ€™s recommended to use zookeeper but there are other options like Hive Metastore and file system (experimental). 

Here is an example spark code from https://hudi.apache.org/docs/concurrency_control/ to enable ACID in writing your data.

```
inputDF.write.format("hudi")
       .options(getQuickstartWriteConfigs)
       .option("hoodie.datasource.write.precombine.field", "ts")
       .option("hoodie.cleaner.policy.failed.writes", "LAZY")
       .option("hoodie.write.concurrency.mode", "optimistic_concurrency_control")
       .option("hoodie.write.lock.zookeeper.url", "zookeeper")
       .option("hoodie.write.lock.zookeeper.port", "2181")
       .option("hoodie.write.lock.zookeeper.base_path", "/test")
       .option("hoodie.datasource.write.recordkey.field", "uuid")
       .option("hoodie.datasource.write.partitionpath.field", "partitionpath")
       .option("hoodie.table.name", tableName)
       .mode(Overwrite)
       .save(basePath)
```

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the integration of ACID transactions into data lakes represents a significant advancement in data management. By providing robust guarantees for data consistency, isolation, atomicity, and durability, ACID transactions empower organizations to leverage the full potential of their data lakes for critical business operations. While challenges such as performance overhead and complexity exist, the benefits of ACID compliance far outweigh the drawbacks. As data lakes continue to evolve into data lakehouses, the adoption of ACID transactions will become increasingly essential for ensuring data reliability and trustworthiness in a world driven by data-driven decision-making.
