As of Hudi v0.10.0, we are excited to introduce support for an advanced Data Layout Optimization technique known in the database realm as [Z-order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-order_curve) and [Hilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve) space filling curves.

# Background

Amazon EMR team recently published a [great article](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/new-features-from-apache-hudi-0-7-0-and-0-8-0-available-on-amazon-emr/) show-casing how [clustering](https://hudi.apache.org/docs/clustering) your data can improve your _query performance_.

To better understand what's going on and how it's related to space-filling curves, let's zoom in to the setup in that article:

In the article, 2 [Apache Hudi](https://hudi.apache.org/docs/overview) tables are compared (both ingested from the well-known [Amazon Reviews](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/index.txt) dataset):

*   `amazon_reviews` table which is not clustered (ie the data has not been re-ordered by any particular key)
*   `amazon_reviews_clustered` table which is clustered. When data is clustered by Apache Hudi the data is [**lexicographically ordered**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographic_order) (hereon we will be referring to this kind of ordering as **_linear ordering_**) by 2 columns: `star_rating`, `total_votes` (see screenshot below)

<img src="/assets/images/hudiconfigz.png" alt="drawing" width="800"/>

_Screenshot of the Hudi configuration (from Amazon EMR team article)_

To showcase the improvement in querying performance, the following queries are executed against both of these tables:

<img src="/assets/images/table1.png" alt="drawing" width="800"/>
<img src="/assets/images/table2.png" alt="drawing" width="800"/>

_Screenshots of the queries run against the previously setup tables (from Amazon EMR team article)_

The important consideration to point out here is that the queries were specifying **both of the columns** latter table is ordered by (both `star_rating` and `total_votes`).

And this is unfortunately a crucial limitation of the linear/lexicographic ordering, the value of the ordering diminishes very quickly as you add more columns. It's not hard to see why:

<img src="/assets/images/lexicographicorder.png" alt="drawing" width="250"/>

_Courtesy of Wikipedia,_ [_Lexicographic Order article_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographic_order)

From this image you can see that with lexicographically ordered 3-tuples of integers, only the first column is able to feature crucial property of **locality** for all of the records having the same value: for ex, all of the records wit values starting with "1", "2", "3" (in the first columns) are nicely clumped together. However if you try to find all the values that have "5" as the value in their third column you'd see that those are now dispersed all over the place, not being localized at all.

The crucial property that improves query performance is locality: it enables queries to substantially reduce the search space and the number of files that need to be scanned, parsed, etc.

But... does this mean that our queries are doomed to do a full-scan if we're filtering by anything other than the first (or more accurate would be to say prefix) of the list of columns the table is ordered by?

Not exactly: luckily, locality is also a property that space-filling curves enable while enumerating multi-dimensional spaces (records in our table could be represented as points in N-dimensional space, where N is the number of columns in our table)

How does it work?

Let's take Z-curve as an example: Z-order curves fitting a 2-dimensional plane would look like the following:

<img src="/assets/images/zordercurve.png" alt="drawing" width="400"/>

_Courtesy of Wikipedia,_ [_Z-order curve article_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-order_curve)

As you can see following its path, instead of simply ordering by one coordinate ("x") first, following with the other, it's actually ordering them as if the bits of those coordinates have been _interwoven_ into a single value:

| Coordinate | X (binary) | Y (binary) | Z-values (ordered) |
| ---| ---| ---| --- |
| (0, 0) | 000 | 000 | 000000 |
| (1, 0) | 001 | 000 | 000001 |
| (0, 1) | 000 | 001 | 000010 |
| (1, 1) | 001 | 001 | 000011 |

This allows for that crucial property of locality (even though a slightly "stretched" one) to be carried over to all columns as compared to just the first one in case of linear ordering.

In a similar fashion, Hilbert curves also allow you to map points in a N-dimensional space (rows in our table) onto 1-dimensional curve, essentially _ordering_ them, while still preserving the crucial property of locality. Read more details about Hilbert Curves [here](https://drum.lib.umd.edu/handle/1903/804). Our personal experiments so far show that ordering data along a Hilbert curve leads to better clustering and performance outcomes.

Now, let's check it out in action!

# Setup
We will use the [Amazon Reviews](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/readme.html) dataset again, but this time we will use Hudi to Z-Order by `product_id`, `customer_id` columns tuple instead of Clustering or _linear ordering_.

No special preparations are required for the dataset, you can simply download it from [S3](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/readme.html) in Parquet format and use it directly as an input for Spark ingesting it into Hudi table.

Launch Spark Shell

```
./bin/spark-shell --master 'local[4]' --driver-memory 8G --executor-memory 8G \
  --jars ../../packaging/hudi-spark-bundle/target/hudi-spark3-bundle_2.12-0.10.0.jar \
  --packages org.apache.spark:spark-avro_2.12:2.4.4 \

# Results
We've summarized the measured performance metrics below:

| **Query** | **Baseline (B)** duration (files scanned / size) | **Linear Sorting (S)** | **Z-order (Z)** duration (scanned) | **Hilbert (H)** duration (scanned) |
| ---| ---| ---| ---| --- |
| Q1 | 14s (543 / 31.4Gb) | 15s (533 / 28.8Gb) | 15s (543 / 31.4Gb) | 14s (541 / 31.3Gb) |
| Q2 | 21s (543 / 31.4Gb) | 10s (533 / 28.8Gb) | **8s** **(243 / 14.4Gb)** | **7s** **(237 / 13.9Gb)** |
| Q3 | 17s (543 / 31.4Gb) | 15s (533 / 28.8Gb) | **6s** **(224 / 12.4Gb)** | **6s** **(219 / 11.9Gb)** |

As you can see multi-column linear ordering is not very effective for the queries that do filtering by columns other than the first one (Q2, Q3).

Which is a very clear contrast with space-filling curves (both Z-order and Hilbert) that allow to speed up query time by up to **3x!**

It's worth noting that the performance gains are heavily dependent on your underlying data and queries. In benchmarks on our internal data we were able to achieve queries performance improvements of more than **11x!**

# Epilogue

Apache Hudi v0.10 brings new layout optimization capabilities Z-order and Hilbert to open source. Using these industry leading layout optimization techniques can bring substantial performance improvement and cost savings to your queries!
