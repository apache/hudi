# Build Your First Hudi Lakehouse with AWS S3 and AWS Glue

Soumil Shah is a Hudi community champion building [YouTube content](https://www.youtube.com/@SoumilShah/playlists) so developers can easily get started incorporating a lakehouse into their data infrastructure. In this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zF4jc_3rFs&list=PLL2hlSFBmWwwbMpcyMjYuRn8cN99gFSY6), Soumil shows you how to get started with AWS Glue, AWS S3, Hudi and Athena.

In this tutorial, youâ€™ll learn how to:
-   Create and configure AWS Glue
-   Create a Hudi Table
-   Create a Spark Data Frame
-   Add data to the Hudi Table 
-   Query data via Athena

**Step 1**: Users in this architecture purchase things from online retailers and generate an order transaction that is kept in DynamoDB.

**Step 2**: The raw data layer stores the order transaction data that is fed into the data lake. To accomplish this, enable Kinesis Data Streams for DynamoDB, and we will stream real-time transactions from DynamoDB into kinesis data streams, process the streaming data with lambda, and insert the data into the next kinesis stream, where a glue streaming job will process and insert the data into Apache Hudi Transaction data lake.
  
**Step 3**: Users can build dashboards and derive insights using QuickSight.

## Getting Started
