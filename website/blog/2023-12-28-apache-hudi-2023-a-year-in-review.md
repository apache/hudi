In the warm glow of the holiday season, I am delighted to convey a message of deep appreciation on behalf of the 
Hudi Project Management Committee (PMC) to all the contributors and users in the community who made 2023 an
extraordinary year for Hudi. 

In 2023, the Hudi community continued strong engagement and activities, evident in the 
[1,832 pull requests created](https://ossinsight.io/analyze/apache/hudi#pull-requests), 
with a significant 1,363 of these being merged. We proudly welcomed 2 new PMC members and 3 new Committers.
Our community [Slack channel](https://apache-hudi.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-20r833rxh-627NWYDUyR8jRtMa2mZ~gg#/) 
witnessed a remarkable 44% increase in users, with numbers exceeding 3,800.
Our presence on social media platforms has grown impressively, with our [X (Twitter) account](https://x.com/apachehudi) 
garnering 2,274 followers, and our newly established [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/apache-hudi/) 
rapidly gaining 2,245 followers in just three months. Letâ€™s take a moment to reflect on and celebrate the myriad of 
exciting developments and accomplishments that have defined the year 2023 for the Hudi community.

## Development Highlights

The year 2023 has been exceptionally productive for Hudi, marked by significant advancements and innovations.
There have been three major releases: [0.13.0](https://hudi.apache.org/releases/release-0.13.0), 
[0.14.0](https://hudi.apache.org/releases/release-0.14.0), and the trailblazing 
[1.0.0-beta1](https://hudi.apache.org/releases/release-1.0.0-beta1) that have collectively reshaped the 
database experience for Hudi data lakehouses. Here are some brief summaries highlighting key features introduced:

### Indexing has elevated to a whole new level

Hudi's new [Record Level Index](https://hudi.apache.org/releases/release-0.14.0#record-level-index)
is a game-changing feature that boosts write performance for large tables. It achieves this by efficiently 
storing per-record locations, enabling rapid retrieval during index look-ups. Benchmarks indicate a 72% 
improvement in write latency compared to the Global Simple Index, alongside notable reductions in query latency 
for equality-matching queries. The new [Consistent Hash Index](https://hudi.apache.org/releases/release-0.14.0#consistent-hashing-index-support)
dynamically scales the buckets for hash-based indexing schemes. By addressing data skew issues inherent in bucket
index, it can achieve blazing fast look-up similar to the Record Level Index during the write process.
[Functional Index](https://hudi.apache.org/releases/release-1.0.0-beta1#functional-index)
enables the creation and deletion of indexes on specific columns, providing users with additional means to
speed up queries and adjust partitioning.

### Write throughput achieves remarkable advancement

A common reason why developers choose Apache Hudi is for its [industry leading write throughput and performance](https://medium.com/@kywe665/delta-hudi-iceberg-a-benchmark-compilation-a5630c69cffc).
The community has continued innovations on write performance including
[Early-conflict detection for OCC](https://hudi.apache.org/releases/release-0.13.0#early-conflict-detection-for-multi-writer)
which proactively validates concurrent writes before they are written to disk, avoiding significant resource wastage
and enhancing throughput. Up-leveling this, the
[Non-Blocking Concurrency Control](https://hudi.apache.org/releases/release-1.0.0-beta1#concurrency-control)
introduced in 1.0 further optimizes multi-writer throughput by allowing conflicts to be resolved later in query
or via compaction. Responding to popular community requests, 
[partial update capability](https://hudi.apache.org/releases/release-0.13.0#support-for-partial-payload-update)
was implemented to allow updates to be applied only to changed fields, particularly benefiting the dimension 
tables that are usually super wide.

### Programming APIs have a brand-new look

[HoodieRecordMerger](https://hudi.apache.org/releases/release-0.13.0#optimizing-record-payload-handling)
is a new abstraction that unifies the merging semantics and makes use of the engine-native representation for
records in the process. Benchmark shows a ballpark of 10-20% boost for upsert performance.
[File Group Reader](https://hudi.apache.org/releases/release-1.0.0-beta1#new-filegroup-reader)
is another API that standardizes File Group access, reducing MoR tables' read latencies by approximately 20%. 
Enabling position-based merging and page-skipping can further accelerate snapshot queries by 5.7 times.

### Usability receives significant attention

[Table-valued function `hudi_table_changes`](https://hudi.apache.org/releases/release-0.14.0#table-valued-function-named-hudi_table_changes-designed-for-incremental-reading-through-spark-sql)
simplifies performing incremental queries via SQLs.
[Auto-generated keys](https://hudi.apache.org/releases/release-0.14.0#support-for-hudi-tables-with-autogenerated-keys)
allows users to omit providing a record key field, especially useful for append-only tables. Among many other 
user-friendly updates, two more notable ones are the addition of a 
[`hudi-cli-bundle` jar](https://hudi.apache.org/releases/release-0.13.0#hudi-cli-bundle)
and a revamped [configuration page](https://hudi.apache.org/docs/basic_configurations).

### Platform capabilities are substantially enhanced

[Changed Data Capture](https://hudi.apache.org/releases/release-0.13.0#change-data-capture)
was supported by logging additional information alongside writers. The changed data, including `before` 
and `after` images, can be served through incremental queries, offering rich analytical insights. 
[Metaserver](https://hudi.apache.org/releases/release-0.13.0#metaserver)
offers centralized management services for operating numerous tables in lakehouse projects, signifying a major
step in Hudi's platform features. 
[`HoodieStreamer`](https://hudi.apache.org/releases/release-0.14.0#hoodiedeltastreamer-renamed-to-hoodiestreamer) 
(formerly `HoodieDeltaStreamer`) remains a highly popular tool for data ingestion:
[new sources](https://hudi.apache.org/releases/release-0.13.0#new-source-support-in-deltastreamer) 
such as Protobuf Kafka source, GCS incremental source, and Pulsar source were added, further expanding 
the integration capabilities.

### Ecosystem integrations undergo notable expansions

On AWS, 
[Athena supported Hudi 0.12.2 and Hudi's metadata table](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/05/amazon-athena-apache-hudi/), 
elevating query performance. 
[AWS Glue crawlers added Hudi support](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/introducing-apache-hudi-support-with-aws-glue-crawlers/) 
with Glue 4.0 working with Hudi 0.12.1, and AWS EMR extended the 
[support matrix](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ReleaseGuide/emr-release-app-versions-6.x.html) 
to cover Hudi 0.13 and 0.14. GCP improved
[Hudi integration in BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/bigquery-manifest-file-support-for-open-table-format-queries) 
with a new manifest file integration for improved performance.
[Starburst also added a Hudi connector](https://docs.starburst.io/latest/connector/hudi.html).
Execution engine support has also been extended to newer versions, including Spark 3.4 and 3.5, 
as well as Flink 1.16, 1.17, and 1.18.

### Interoperability is the key

While Apache Hudi continues its strong growth momentum, some members of the community also decided it is time to 
start building interoperability bridges across Lakehouse table formats with Delta Lake and Iceberg. The 
[recent announcement about OneTable becoming open source](https://www.onehouse.ai/blog/onetable-is-now-open-source)
marks a big leap forward for all developers looking to build a data lakehouse architecture. This development not 
only emphasizes Hudi's commitment to openness but also enables a wider range of users to experience the 
technological advantages offered by Hudi.

### Stay tuned for 2024

The File Group Reader APIs are poised for widespread adoption, promising benefits for numerous query 
engines. We also anticipate broad adoption for Non-Blocking Concurrency Control. And there's more on 
the horizon, including innovations like infinite timeline, secondary indexes, multi-table transactions, 
and the support for unstructured data. For the latest updates and detailed insights, I encourage you to
