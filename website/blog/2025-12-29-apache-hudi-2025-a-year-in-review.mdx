As we close out 2025, it's clear that this has been a transformative year for Apache Hudi. The community continued to grow, delivered major advances in interoperability and performance, published "The Definitive Guide" book, and expanded our global reach through meetups, conferences, and adoption worldwide.

## Community and Growth

2025 brought steady momentum in contributions and community engagement.

<img src="/assets/images/blog/2025-12-29-apache-hudi-2025-a-year-in-review/01-pr-history.png" alt="drawing" style={{width:'100%', display:'block', marginLeft:'auto', marginRight:'auto', marginTop:'18pt', marginBottom:'18pt'}} />

GitHub pull request activities remained steady throughout 2025, reflecting consistent development momentum. GitHub contributors reached over 500. Community engagement also grew — followers across social media platforms (LinkedIn, X, YouTube, and WeChat) increased to about 35,000, while Slack community users grew to close to 5,000.

The project celebrated new milestones in contributor recognition. [Yue Zhang](https://people.apache.org/committer-index.html#zhangyue19921010) was elected to the Project Management Committee (PMC) for driving several major RFCs and features, evangelizing Hudi at meetups, and leading the effort to productionize hundreds of petabytes at JD.COM. [Tim Brown](https://people.apache.org/committer-index.html#timbrown) was nominated as a committer for modernizing read/write operations behind Hudi 1.1's performance gains. [Shawn Chang](https://people.apache.org/committer-index.html#schang) was nominated as a committer for strengthening Spark integration and expanding Hudi adoption on AWS EMR.

## Development Highlights

[Hudi 1.1](https://hudi.apache.org/releases/release-1.1) landed with over 800 commits from 50+ contributors. The headline feature is the pluggable table format framework — Hudi's storage engine is now pluggable, allowing its battle-tested transaction management, indexing, and concurrency control to work while storing data in Hudi's native format or other table formats like [Apache Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org/) via [Apache XTable (Incubating)](https://xtable.apache.org/).

<img src="/assets/images/blog/2025-12-29-apache-hudi-2025-a-year-in-review/03-hudi11.jpg" alt="drawing" style={{width:'80%', display:'block', marginLeft:'auto', marginRight:'auto', marginTop:'18pt', marginBottom:'18pt'}} />

Performance saw major gains across the board. Parquet binary copy for clustering delivered 10-15x faster execution with 95% compute reduction. Apache Flink writer achieved 2-3x improved throughput with Avro conversion eliminated in the write path. Apache Spark metadata-table streaming ran ~18% faster for update-heavy workloads. Indexing enhancements — partitioned record index, partition-level bucket index, HFile caching, and Bloom filters — delivered up to 4x speedup for lookups on massive tables.

Spark 4.0 and Flink 2.0 support was added. [Apache Polaris (Incubating)](https://polaris.apache.org/) catalog integration enabled multi-engine queries with unified governance. Operational simplicity improved with storage-based locking that eliminated external dependencies. New merge modes replaced legacy payload classes with declarative options, and SQL procedures enhanced table management directly in Spark SQL. See more details in the [release blog](https://hudi.apache.org/blog/2025/11/25/apache-hudi-release-1-1-announcement/).

[Hudi-rs](https://github.com/apache/hudi-rs) expanded its feature support — release 0.3.0 introduced Merge-on-Read and incremental queries, while 0.4.0 added C++ bindings and Avro log file support. The native Rust implementation now powers Ray Data and Daft integrations for ML and multi-cloud analytics.

## New Book Published

[Apache Hudi: The Definitive Guide](https://www.onehouse.ai/whitepaper/apache-hudi-the-definitive-guide), published by O'Reilly, distills Hudi's 8+ years of innovation from 500+ contributors into a comprehensive resource for data engineers and architects.

<img src="/assets/images/blog/2025-12-29-apache-hudi-2025-a-year-in-review/02-book-cover.png" alt="drawing" style={{width:'80%', display:'block', marginLeft:'auto', marginRight:'auto', marginTop:'18pt', marginBottom:'18pt'}} />

Across 10 chapters, the guide covers writing and reading patterns, indexing strategies, table maintenance, concurrency handling, streaming pipelines with Hudi Streamer, and production deployment. With practical examples spanning batch, interactive, and streaming analytics, it takes you from getting started to building end-to-end lakehouse solutions at enterprise scale.

## Meetups and Conferences

Community events brought together thousands of attendees across meetups and conferences worldwide.

### Bangalore Hudi Community Meetup

A full-house gathering took place at Onehouse's India office in January, featuring deep dives into Hudi 1.0 and lakehouse architecture. The event connected developers, contributors, and enthusiasts from India's growing data engineering community.

### CMU Database Seminar

Vinoth Chandar, Hudi PMC Chair, presented "[Apache Hudi: A Database Layer Over Cloud Storage for Fast Mutations & Queries](https://youtu.be/AYaw06_Xazo)" at Carnegie Mellon University's [Future Data Systems Seminar](https://db.cs.cmu.edu/events/futuredata-apache-hudi/). The talk covered how Hudi brings database-like abstractions to data lakes — enabling efficient mutations, transaction management, and fast incremental reads through storage layout, indexing, and concurrency control design decisions. A must-watch that covers both the breadth and depth of Hudi's design concepts and what problems it solves.

### OpenXData

Amazon engineers presented "[Powering Amazon Unit Economics at Scale Using Hudi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmAeQ57AGmc)" at [OpenXData](https://www.openxdata.ai/), sharing how they built Nexus — a scalable, configuration-driven platform with Hudi as the cornerstone of its data lake architecture. The talk highlighted how Hudi enables Amazon to tackle the massive challenge of understanding and improving unit-level profitability across their ever-growing businesses.

## Looking Ahead

The upcoming releases in 2026 will bring AI/ML-focused capabilities — including unstructured data types, column groups for embeddings, vector search, and Lance/Vortex format support. We'll also continue expanding multi-format interoperability through the pluggable table format framework and advancing streaming-first optimizations for real-time ingestion and sub-minute freshness.
