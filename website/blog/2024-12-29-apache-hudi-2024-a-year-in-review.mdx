## Major Milestones

### Apache Hudi 1.0 Release

2024 marked a historic moment with the [release of Apache Hudi 1.0](https://hudi.apache.org/releases/release-1.0.0), representing a major evolution in data lakehouse technology. This release brought several groundbreaking features:

- **Secondary Indexing**: First of its kind in lakehouses, enabling database-like query acceleration with demonstrated 95% latency reduction on 10TB TPC-DS for low-moderate selectivity queries
- **Logical Partitioning via Expression Indexes**: Introducing PostgreSQL-style expression indexes for more efficient partition management
- **Partial Updates**: Achieving 2.6x performance improvement and 85% reduction in bytes written for update-heavy workloads
- **Non-blocking Concurrency Control (NBCC)**: An industry-first feature allowing simultaneous writing from multiple writers
- **Merge Modes**: First-class support for both `commit_time_ordering` and `event_time_ordering`
- **LSM Timeline**: Revamped timeline storage as a scalable LSM tree for extended table history retention
- **TrueTime**: Strengthened time semantics ensuring forward-moving clocks in distributed processes

### Launch of Hudi-rs

A significant expansion of the Hudi ecosystem occurred with the [release of Hudi-rs](https://github.com/apache/hudi-rs), the native Rust implementation for Apache Hudi with Python API bindings. This new project enables:

- Reading Hudi Tables without Spark or JVM dependencies
- Integration with Apache Arrow for enhanced compatibility
