        <description>The name of the default file system.  A URI whose
            scheme and authority determine the FileSystem implementation.  The
            uri's scheme determines the config property (fs.SCHEME.impl) naming
            the FileSystem implementation class.  The uri's authority is used to
            determine the host, port, etc. for a filesystem.</description>
