# Apache Hudi (Incubating)
Apache Hudi (Incubating) (pronounced Hoodie) stands for `Hadoop Upserts Deletes and Incrementals`. 
Hudi manages the storage of large analytical datasets on DFS (Cloud stores, HDFS or any Hadoop FileSystem compatible storage).

## Features
* Upsert support with fast, pluggable indexing
* Atomically publish data with rollback support
* Snapshot isolation between writer & queries 
* Savepoints for data recovery
* Manages file sizes, layout using statistics
* Async compaction of row & columnar data
* Timeline metadata to track lineage
 
Hudi provides the ability to query via three types of views:
 * **Read Optimized View** - Provides excellent snapshot query performance via purely columnar storage (e.g. [Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/)).
 * **Incremental View** - Provides a change stream with records inserted or updated after a point in time.
 * **Real-time View** - Provides snapshot queries on real-time data, using a combination of columnar & row-based storage (e.g [Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/) + [Avro](https://avro.apache.org/docs/current/mr.html)).
