# Generation of test files

These files are generated by using the test: 
`org/apache/spark/sql/hudi/dml/schema/TestVariantDataType.scala:31`

Spark4.0 is required for this. 

The shell commands used to generate this are:

```shell
cd /path/to/test/files/
zip -r zip_file.zip htestvariantdatatype_1
```

The test runs on these four arguments:
1. COW + HoodieRecordType.AVRO
2. COW + HoodieRecordType.SPARK
3. MOR + HoodieRecordType.AVRO
4. MOR + HoodieRecordType.SPARK

COW tables generated are the same for both AVRO/SPARK. But for MOR, the log files metadata are 
different. Hence, we only need to generate test files for either 1/2, 3 and 4, hence, 3 test 
resource files.
