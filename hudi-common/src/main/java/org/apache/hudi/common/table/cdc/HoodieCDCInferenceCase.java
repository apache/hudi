/**
 * Here define five cdc infer cases. The different cdc infer case will decide which file will be
 * used to extract the change data, and how to do this.
 *
 * AS_IS:
 *   For this type, there must be a real cdc log file from which we get the whole/part change data.
 *   when `hoodie.table.cdc.supplemental.logging.mode` is {@link HoodieCDCSupplementalLoggingMode#data_before_after}, it keeps all the fields about the
 *   change data, including `op`, `ts_ms`, `before` and `after`. So read it and return directly,
 *   no more other files need to be loaded.
 *   when `hoodie.table.cdc.supplemental.logging.mode` is {@link HoodieCDCSupplementalLoggingMode#data_before}, it keeps the `op`, the key and the
 *   `before` of the changing record. When `op` is equal to 'i' or 'u', need to get the current record from the
 *   current base/log file as `after`.
 *   when `hoodie.table.cdc.supplemental.logging.mode` is 'op_key', it just keeps the `op` and the key of
 *   the changing record. When `op` is equal to 'i', `before` is null and get the current record
 *   from the current base/log file as `after`. When `op` is equal to 'u', get the previous
 *   record from the previous file slice as `before`, and get the current record from the
 *   current base/log file as `after`. When `op` is equal to 'd', get the previous record from
 *   the previous file slice as `before`, and `after` is null.
 *
 * BASE_FILE_INSERT:
 *   For this type, there must be a base file at the current instant. All the records from this
 *   file is new-coming, so we can load this, mark all the records with `i`, and treat them as
 *   the value of `after`. The value of `before` for each record is null.
 *
 * BASE_FILE_DELETE:
 *   For this type, there must be an empty file at the current instant, but a non-empty base file
 *   at the previous instant. First we find this base file that has the same file group and belongs
 *   to the previous instant. Then load this, mark all the records with `d`, and treat them as
 *   the value of `before`. The value of `after` for each record is null.
 *
 * LOG_FILE:
 *   For this type, a normal log file of mor table will be used. First we need to load the previous
 *   file slice(including the base file and other log files in the same file group). Then for each
 *   record from the log file, get the key of this, and execute the following steps:
 *     1) if the record is deleted,
 *       a) if there is a record with the same key in the data loaded, `op` is 'd', 'before' is the
 *          record from the data loaded, `after` is null;
 *       b) if there is not a record with the same key in the data loaded, just skip.
 *     2) the record is not deleted,
 *       a) if there is a record with the same key in the data loaded, `op` is 'u', 'before' is the
 *          record from the data loaded, `after` is the current record;
 *       b) if there is not a record with the same key in the data loaded, `op` is 'i', 'before' is
 *          null, `after` is the current record;
 *
 * REPLACE_COMMIT:
 *   For this type, it must be a replacecommit, like INSERT_OVERWRITE and DROP_PARTITION. It drops
 *   a whole file group. First we find this file group. Then load this, mark all the records with
 *   `d`, and treat them as the value of `before`. The value of `after` for each record is null.
