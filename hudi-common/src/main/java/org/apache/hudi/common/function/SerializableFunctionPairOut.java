/**
 * A serializable functional interface that represents a function taking an input value
 * and returning a key-value pair result. This interface is designed to be used in distributed computing
 * scenarios where functions need to be serialized and transmitted across network boundaries.
 *
 * <p>This interface extends {@link Serializable} and is marked as a functional interface,
 * making it suitable for use with lambda expressions and method references in distributed
 * processing frameworks.</p>
 *
 * <p>The function signature follows the pattern: I â†’ (K, V), where I is the input type,
 * K is the output key type, and V is the output value type.</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>Example usage:</strong></p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Create a function that splits a string into key-value pair
 * SerializableFunctionPairOut<String, String, Integer> splitFunction =
 *     str -> Pair.of(str.split(":")[0], Integer.parseInt(str.split(":")[1]));
 *
 * // Use in a stream or processing pipeline
 * Pair<String, Integer> result = splitFunction.call("user:123"); // Returns Pair("user", 123)
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p><strong>Note:</strong> The {@code call} method is declared to throw {@link Exception},
 * allowing implementations to handle various error conditions that may occur during
 * processing.</p>
 *
 * @param <I> the type of the input parameter
 * @param <K> the type of the output key
 * @param <V> the type of the output value
