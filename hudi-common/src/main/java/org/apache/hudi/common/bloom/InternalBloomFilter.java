/**
 * Implements a <i>Bloom filter</i>, as defined by Bloom in 1970.
 * <p>
 * The code in class is adapted from {@link org.apache.hadoop.util.bloom.BloomFilter} in Apache Hadoop.
 * The serialization and deserialization are completely the same as and compatible with Hadoop's
 * {@link org.apache.hadoop.util.bloom.BloomFilter}, so that this class correctly reads bloom
 * filters serialized by older Hudi versions using Hadoop's BloomFilter.
 * <p>
 * Hudi serializes bloom filter(s) and write them to Parquet file footers and metadata table's
 * bloom filter partition containing bloom filters for all data files.  We want to maintain the
 * serde of a bloom filter and thus the code in Hudi repo to avoid breaking changes in storage
 * format and bytes.
 * <p>
 * The Bloom filter is a data structure that was introduced in 1970 and that has been adopted by
 * the networking research community in the past decade thanks to the bandwidth efficiencies that it
 * offers for the transmission of set membership information between networked hosts.  A sender encodes
 * the information into a bit vector, the Bloom filter, that is more compact than a conventional
 * representation. Computation and space costs for construction are linear in the number of elements.
 * The receiver uses the filter to test whether various elements are members of the set. Though the
 * filter will occasionally return a false positive, it will never return a false negative. When creating
 * the filter, the sender can choose its desired point in a trade-off between the false positive rate and the size.
