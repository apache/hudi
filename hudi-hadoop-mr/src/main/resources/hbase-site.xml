        <description>Set to true to skip the 'hbase.defaults.for.version' check.
            Setting this to true can be useful in contexts other than
            the other side of a maven generation; i.e. running in an
            IDE. You'll want to set this boolean to true to avoid
            seeing the RuntimeException complaint: "hbase-default.xml file
            seems to be for and old version of HBase (\${hbase.version}), this
            version is X.X.X-SNAPSHOT"
