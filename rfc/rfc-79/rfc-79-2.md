# Add support for cancellable table service plans

## Proposers


## Approvers

## Status

JIRA: HUDI-7946


## Abstract
Table service plans can delay ingestion writes from updating a dataset with recent data, if potential write conflicts are detected. Furthermore, a table service plan that isn't executed to completion for a large amount of time (due to repeated failures, application misconfiguration, or insufficient resources) will degrade the performance of a dataset due to delaying clean, archival, and compaction. This is because currently HUDI table service plans, upon being scheduled, must be executed to completion. And in addition, will prevent any ingestion write targeting the same files from succeeding (due to posing as a write conflict) and will prevent any new table service plan from targeting the same files. Enabling a user to configure a table service plan as "cancellable" can prevent frequent table service plans from delaying ingestion and can provide users an avenue to fully cancel a table service plan and allow other table service to proceed.


## Background
### Execution of table services 
The table service operations compact and cluster are by default "immutable" plans, meaning that once a plan is scheduled it will stay as as a pending instant until a caller invokes the table service execute API on the table service instant and sucessfully completes it. Specifically, if an inflight execution fails after transitioning the instant to inflight, the next execution attempt will implictly create and execute a rollback plan (which will delete all new instant/data files), but will keep the table service plan. This process will repeat until the instant is completed. The below visualization captures these transitions at a high level

## Goals
### (1) A cancellable plan should be pre-empted by other writers
The current requirement of HUDI needing to execute a table service plan to completion forces ingestion writers to abort a commit if a table service plan is conflicting. Becuase an ingestion writer typically determines the exact files it will be targeting after building a workload profile and performing record tagging, the writer may have already spent a lot of time and resources before realizing that it needs to abort. In the face of frequent table service plans or an old inflight plan, this will cause delays in adding recent upstream records to the dataset as well as unecessairly take away resources (such as Spark executors in the case of Spark engine) from other applications in the data lake. A cancellable table service plan should avoid this situation by preventing itself from being comitted if a conflicting ingestion job has been comitted already. In conjunction, any ingestion writer or non-cancellable table service writer should be able to infer that a conflicting inflight table service plan is cancellable, and therefore can be ignored when attempting to commit the instant.

### (2) An inflight cancellable plan should be automatically cleaned up
Another consequence of this existing table service flow is that a table service plan cannot be subject to clean's rollback of failed writes. Clean typically performs a rollback of inflight instants that are no longer being progressed by a writer (and have an inactive heartbeat). Because table service plans needed to be executed to completion and don't have an active heartbeat these inflight plans cannot be subject to this cleanup. Because an inflight plan remaining on the timeline can degrade performance of reads/writes (as mentioned earlier), a cancellable table service plan should be elligible to be targeted for cleanup if an application deems that it has remaining inflight for too long (or some other critera). Note that a failed table service should still be able to be safely cleaned up immeditaley - the goal here is just to make usre an inflight plan won't stay on the timeline for an unbounded amount of time.

## Design
### Enabling a plan to be pre-emptable
To satisfy goal (1), a new config flag "cancellable" can be added to a table service plan. A writer that intends to schedule a cancellable table service plan can enable the flag in the serialized plan metadata. Any writer executing the plan can infer that the plan is cancellable, and when trying to commit the instant will abort if it detects that any ingestion write or table service plan (without cancellable config flag) is targeting the same file groups. On the other side, the pre-commit flow for ingestion writers can be updated to ignore any inflight table service plans if they are cancellable.

### Handling cancellation of plans
An additional config "cancellation-policy" can be added to the table service plan to indicate when it is ellgible to be permenatnly rolled back by writers other than the one responsbible for executing the table service. This policy can be a threshold of hours or instants on timeline, where if that # of hours/instants have elapsed since the plan was scheduled, any writer/operation can target it for rollback. This policy should be configured by the writer scheduling a cacnellable table service, based on the amount of time they expect the plan to remain on the timeline before it is picked up for execution. For example, if a table service writer is expected to immeditately start executing the plan after scheduling it, the the cancellation-policy can just be a few minutes. On the other hand, if the plan is expected to have it's execution deferred to a few hours later, then the cancellation-policy should be more lenient. Note that this cancellation policy is not a repalacement for determining wether a table service plan is currently being executed - as wtih ingestion writes, cleanup of a cancellable table service plan should only start once it is confirmed that the current writer is no longer progressing it. 

In order to ensure that other writers can indeed rollback a plan such that is no longer inflight (and can never be re-executed), additional changes to clean and table service flow will be need to be added as well. Two proposals are detailed below. Also, the cancellation-policy is only required to be honored by clean: a user can choose setup an application to aggresively clean up a failed cancellable table service plan even if it has not meet critera for cancellation-policy yet. This can be useful if a user wants a utility to manually ensure that clean/archival for a dataset progresses or knows that a cancellable table service plan will not be attempted again or cleaned up by another writer. Each proposal provides an example on how to achieve this.

#### (A) Making cancellable plans "mutable" 
Cancellable table service plan can be updated to have a "mutuable" plan, in the sense that once a plan is transitioned to inflight, if execution of it fails the plan must be rolled back and deleted, similar to rollback of failed ingestion writes. The flow for table service execution will be similar to the existing one for immutable plan, except that if the plan was transitioned to inflight or targeted by a rollback plan execution will abort.

Once cancellable table service plans are made mutable in this manner, clean can rollback failed cancellable table service plans that have meet the cancellation-policy critera, similar to how clean currently rolls back failed ingestion writes. Specifically, clean can check for any failed cancelled table service plans that have transitioned to inflight or meet the cancellation-policy. From there a rollback can be scheduled and executed for each instant.
With these changes, a failed cancellable table service plan that has met its cancellation policy will be guaranteed to be attempted for rollback by the next clean. If a user wants to immeditaly cleanup a failed cancellable plan, they can bypass the cancellation policy by scheduling and executing a rollback plan, the same way that clean will cleanup these plans.

This meets the critera for goal (2). But comes with the following drawbacks
* A cacnellable table service plan can only be attempted once, after being transitioned to inflight
* The instant metadata file for the cancellable table service plan will be deleted on rollback, analogous to how rollback of a ingestion instant works. This can make it more difficult to debug failed/stuck cancellable table service plans

The reason this approach cannot tolerate re-executing an inflight cancellable plan is due to write conflict resolution. If a failed cancellable table service plan appears in the timeline, it is ambigious wether the write failed due to being blocked by a conflicting write or due to a transient failure. In order to simplify this flow, this approach assumes that a failed plan might have failed due to write conflict and therefore should not be re-attempted.
  
#### (B) Adding a cancel operation/state for cancellable plans
An alternate approach can involve updating the possible tmeline actions / states, by making the following changes:
* Add an ".aborted" state type for cancellable table service plan. 
* Add a new action type "cancel" with two states ".cancel.requested" and ".cancel". The  ".cancel.requested" metadata file will be a plan that targets a (cancellable table service) instant. Once said instant is transitioned to aborted state, the action can be completed and transitioned to ".cancel"

A new cancel API will be added that a writer can use to target a cancellable table service plan to be aborted. It will create a cancel.request plan for the target instant, and execute it. If an existing cancel.requested plan for the target already exists, it will try to execute that directly (similar to how rollback API handles pending rollbacks). Execution of a cancel action involves the followings steps
1. Rollback the instant without deleting the table service plan
2. Transition the table service instant to .aborted
3. Transition the cancel plan to .cancel
Once the cancel action has been transitioned to ".cancel", it can be considred complete. The reason this cancel action needs a ".requested" state is in order to allow clean/archival to be able to infer when a cancel action is completed or still ongoing.

Similar to (A), clean will also be updated to cleanup any inactive cancellable table service plan that meets the critera for it's cancellation policy. It will do this cleanup by scheduling / executing cancellation plans for each affected cancellable table service instant. If execution of a given cancellation plan fails, the next clean attempt can just re-attempt it (similar how clean currently will re-attempt pending rollback plans of completed ingestion instants).

In conjunction with this cancel API, the flow for execution of table service execution logic (for cancellable plans) will be updated to account for the plan being under cancellation. Specifically this flow should itself transition the instant to aborted state if it fails due to write conflict resolution or is already target of a cacnellaton plan. See the visualization below (existing table service execution logic for immutable plan is greyed out).
