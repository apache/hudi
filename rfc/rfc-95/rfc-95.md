# Motivation

During read, currently Hudi supports three paths to merge records during runtime:

* By APIs provided by `HoodieRecordPayload`
* By various merger instances inherited from `HoodieRecordMerger`
* Through merge mode, when the semantic is standard commit time or event time based

Unified APIs should be desired to simplify the Hudi repo. This RFC proposes to deprecate the usage of `HoodieRecordPayload` in Hudi.

---

# Requirements

* Standard merge logic is handled by setting `RecordMergeMode` (i.e., `COMMIT_TIME_ORDERING`, `EVENT_TIME_ORDERING`)
* Partial merge logic is natively handled within each of the merge modes – it is **not** a separate merge mode
* Custom merge logic (if absolutely needed) can be handled by merger classes inherited from `HoodieRecordMerger`
* Our goal is to deprecate legacy payloads as much as possible
* Several OSS users are using custom payloads, and these should continue to work

---

## Payload and Writer Usages Callout

* Not all payloads can be used across all different writers: Spark SQL, Spark DataSource, and HoodieStreamer
* `MySqlDebeziumAvroPayload` and `PostgresDebeziumAvroPayload` need a transformer and can only be used with HoodieStreamer
* `ExpressionPayload` is only used for Spark SQL writes

**TL;DR:** Some payloads require a transformer, which only works with HoodieStreamer

## Partial Update Mode

A new table config `hoodie.write.partial.update.mode=<value>` will control partial update behavior.

| Mode              | Description                                                             |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `KEEP_VALUES`     | (default) Use previous value if column is missing in the current record |
| `FILL_DEFAULTS`   | Use schema default if column is missing in current record               |
| `IGNORE_DEFAULTS` | Use previous value if current value equals schema default               |
| `IGNORE_MARKERS`  | Use previous value if current column equals a marker value              |

**Note**: Marker value is set via `hoodie.write.partial.custom.marker` table property.

# Q\&A

### How do we support old Hudi version readers?

Retain old table properties including payload class configs and **also** add new merge mode properties.
This ensures:

* Old readers (e.g., Trino/Presto) that read table version 8 will continue to work
* New readers will switch to merge mode-based reads (table version 9)

---

# Open Items

* Should writers fully abandon mergers for standard merge modes?

    * Only `CopyOnWrite` merge handle may need update
    * Other paths either don’t need merger or already use `FileGroupReader`
