      Apache Hudi is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/">Apache Incubator</a>.
      Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have
      stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a
      reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
