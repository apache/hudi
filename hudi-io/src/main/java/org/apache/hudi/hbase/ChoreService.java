/**
 * ChoreService is a service that can be used to schedule instances of {@link ScheduledChore} to run
 * periodically while sharing threads. The ChoreService is backed by a
 * {@link ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor} whose core pool size changes dynamically depending on the
 * number of {@link ScheduledChore} scheduled. All of the threads in the core thread pool of the
 * underlying {@link ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor} are set to be daemon threads.
 * <p>
 * The ChoreService provides the ability to schedule, cancel, and trigger instances of
 * {@link ScheduledChore}. The ChoreService also provides the ability to check on the status of
 * scheduled chores. The number of threads used by the ChoreService changes based on the scheduling
 * load and whether or not the scheduled chores are executing on time. As more chores are scheduled,
 * there may be a need to increase the number of threads if it is noticed that chores are no longer
 * meeting their scheduled start times. On the other hand, as chores are cancelled, an attempt is
 * made to reduce the number of running threads to see if chores can still meet their start times
 * with a smaller thread pool.
 * <p>
 * When finished with a ChoreService it is good practice to call {@link ChoreService#shutdown()}.
 * Calling this method ensures that all scheduled chores are cancelled and cleaned up properly.
