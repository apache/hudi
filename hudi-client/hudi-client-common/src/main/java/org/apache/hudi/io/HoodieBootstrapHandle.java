 * 1) Schema : Metadata bootstrap writes only metadata fields as part of write. So, setup the writer schema accordingly.
 * 2) canWrite is overridden to always return true so that skeleton file and bootstrap file is aligned and we don't end up
 *    writing more than 1 skeleton file for the same bootstrap file.
