Start using the datasource API or the WriteClient to write to the table and make sure you start writing\nto a new partition or convert your last N partitions into Hudi instead of the entire table. Note, since the historical\npartitions are not managed by HUDI, none of the primitives provided by HUDI work on the data in those partitions.
