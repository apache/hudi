In a typical streaming scenario, events can arrive out of sequence due to network latency, processing delays, or other factors. With the increasing volume and velocity of data being ingested from various sources\u2014especially in mobile applications and IoT platforms\u2014data processing frameworks must be equipped to handle mutations (i.e., changes to records) and out-of-order events.\nTraditional data storage systems and file formats, such as those optimized for batch processing, often struggle to manage these scenarios effectively. Hudi steps in with features specifically designed to handle such challenges.\nWhen events or changes to a record arrive at different times, they may not be in the same order in which they were originally generated. For example, in a smart city traffic monitoring system, sensors may report vehicle speeds at various intersections in real-time. However, due to network issues or delays, some sensor data might arrive later than others, possibly out of order. To handle this, the system needs to merge the new incoming data with existing records efficiently. Just like how Hudi\u2019s merge modes control the merging of records with the same key in a storage system, ensuring consistency and accuracy, it ensures that the final traffic data reflects the correct event times, even when some data arrives with a delay. These merge modes help maintain a consistent, deterministic result under heavy load, making sure that late data updates the right records without causing inconsistencies.\nThis can lead to several issues:"}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.h4,{id:"data-integrity",children:"Data Integrity"}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"When events are processed out of order, it can result in incorrect or inconsistent data states.

By merging changes upfront, Hudi reduces unnecessary records, improving the efficiency of both query and write operations.\nThis step is crucial for handling stream data in real-time, where changes may arrive rapidly, and ensuring that only the final version of the record is written into the system.
