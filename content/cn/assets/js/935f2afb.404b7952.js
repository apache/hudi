Unlike general purpose file version control, Hudi draws clear distinction between writer processes (that issue user\u2019s upserts/deletes), table services (that write data/metadata to optimize/perform bookkeeping) and readers (that execute queries and read data). Hudi provides snapshot isolation between all three types of processes, meaning they all operate on a consistent snapshot of the table. Hudi provides optimistic concurrency control (OCC) between writers, while providing lock-free, non-blocking Multiversion Concurrency Control (MVCC) based concurrency control between writers and table-services and between different table services.","sidebar":"docs"},"configurations":{"id":"configurations","title":"\u914d\u7f6e","description":"\u8be5\u9875\u9762\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u51e0\u79cd\u914d\u7f6e\u5199\u5165\u6216\u8bfb\u53d6Hudi\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u4f5c\u4e1a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002","sidebar":"docs"},"cos_hoodie":{"id":"cos_hoodie","title":"COS Filesystem","description":"\u8fd9\u4e2a\u9875\u9762\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u8ba9\u4f60\u7684Hudi spark\u4efb\u52a1\u4f7f\u7528Tencent Cloud COS\u5b58\u50a8\u3002","sidebar":"docs"},"deployment":{"id":"deployment","title":"\u7ba1\u7406 Hudi Pipelines","description":"\u7ba1\u7406\u5458/\u8fd0\u7ef4\u4eba\u5458\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee5\u4e0b\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e86\u89e3Hudi\u6570\u636e\u96c6/\u7ba1\u9053","sidebar":"docs"},"disaster_recovery":{"id":"disaster_recovery","title":"Disaster Recovery","description":"Disaster Recovery is very much mission-critical for any software.

Hudi also incorporates essential table services that are tightly integrated with the database kernel. These services can be executed automatically across both ingested and derived data to manage various aspects such as table bookkeeping, metadata, and storage layout.
