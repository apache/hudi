If users want to use Hudi as their data lake framework, they must introduce Spark into their platform technology stack.\nA few years ago, using Spark as a big data processing engine can be said to be very common or even natural. Since Spark can either perform batch processing or use micro-batch to simulate streaming, one engine solves both streaming and batch problems.\nHowever, in recent years, with the development of big data technology, Flink, which is also a big data processing engine, has gradually entered people's vision and has occupied a certain market in the field of computing engines.\nIn the big data technology community, forums and other territories, the voice of whether Hudi supports Flink has gradually appeared and has become more frequent. Therefore, it is a valuable thing to make Hudi support the Flink engine, and the first step of integrating the Flink engine is that Hudi and Spark are decoupled."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"In addition, looking at the mature, active, and viable frameworks in the big data, all frameworks are elegant in design and can be integrated with other frameworks and leverage each other's expertise.\nTherefore, decoupling Hudi from Spark and turning it into an engine-independent data lake framework will undoubtedly create more possibilities for the integration of Hudi and other components, allowing Hudi to better integrate into the big data ecosystem."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.h2,{id:"2-challenges",children:"2.

Since the data source reads the data, and finally writes the data to the table, Spark RDD is used as the main data structure everywhere, and even ordinary tools are implemented using the Spark API.\nIt can be said that Hudi is a universal data lake framework implemented by Spark. Hudi also leverages deep Spark functionality like custom partitioning, in-memory caching to implement indexing and file sizing using workload heuristics.\nFor some of these, Flink offers better out-of-box support (e.g using Flink\u2019s state store for indexing) and can in fact, make Hudi approach real-time latencies more and more."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"In addition, the primary engine integrated after this decoupling is Flink. Flink and Spark differ greatly in core abstraction. Spark believes that data is bounded, and its core abstraction is a limited set of data.\nFlink believes that the essence of data is a stream, and its core abstract DataStream contains various operations on data. Hudi has a streaming first design (record level updates, record level streams), that arguably fit the Flink model more naturally.\nAt the same time, there are multiple RDDs operating at the same time in Hudi, and the processing result of one RDD is combined with another RDD.\nThis difference in abstraction and the reuse of intermediate results during implementation make it difficult for Hudi to use a unified API to operate both RDD and DataStream in terms of decoupling abstraction."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.h2,{id:"3-decoupling-spark",children:"3.

In order to ensure the performance and stability of the Hudi Spark version as much as possible. We can keep setting the bounded data set as the basic operation unit.\nHudi's main operation API remains unchanged, and RDD is extracted as a generic type.
