Next, we argued that to support incremental processing, we must have at least two primitives: upsert and\nincremental consumption, and explained why these two primitives can solve the problems explained above."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,'Then, we introduced why incremental processing is also important to the data lake. There are many common parts in data processing between the data lake and the data warehouse.\nIn the data warehouse, some "pain points" caused by the lack of incremental processing also exist in the data lake. We elaborated its significance to the data lake from four\naspects: incremental processing of semantics of natural fit flow, the need for analytical scenarios, quasi-real-time scene resource/efficiency trade-offs, and unified lake architecture.'),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"Finally, we introduced the open source data lake storage framework Apache Hudi's support for incremental processing and simple cases."))}h.isMDXComponent=!0},5779:function(e,t,a){t.Z=a.p+"assets/images/image1-3639ab8c9d27f6e461866dc83e8346c0.png"},8405:function(e,t,a){t.Z=a.p+"assets/images/image2-971db03016b54c2da63fec8a2df4f412.png"},7792:function(e,t,a){t.Z=a.p+"assets/images/image3-8f35b19f5afc8d6b571f4479eb024189.png"},674:function(e,t,a){t.Z=a.p+"assets/images/image4-e0b30b97adaffc9f1a9cf2eb8f0a9c52.jpg"},2856:function(e,t,a){t.Z=a.p+"assets/images/image5-58bbba66797e915ba7518ad7e61bcd56.png"},7745:function(e,t,a){t.Z=a.p+"assets/images/image6-3f3cbe07ee5f79cce9b6f18241058961.png"},6452:function(e,t,a){t.Z=a.p+"assets/images/image7-b669c80a71be700ccbd8bc0945b5d762.png"},9122:function(e,t,a){t.Z=a.p+"assets/images/image8-953168c35d108f42143d2942a7197941.png"}}]);
