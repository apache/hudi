When a new record is ingested into the Hudi table, the system first derives  the HoodieKey of the incoming record based on the unique key and partitioning schema configured.

The same extraction logic needs to be applied to all streams, and any table maintenance activities (such as bootstrapping or backfilling) also require this logic to be reapplied. This repetition is error-prone and can lead to data consistency issues if the logic is incorrectly applied.\nHudi addresses these challenges with a built-in solution: key generators.

Hudi uses key generators to extract the Hudi record key, which is a combination of the record key and the partition key, from the incoming record fields. This process allows Hudi to efficiently prepare the hoodie key on which updates can occur. During upserts, Hudi identifies the file group that contains the specified hoodie key using an index and updates the corresponding file group accordingly.\nHudi offers several built-in key generator implementations that cover common use cases, such as generating record keys based on fields from the input data. However, to provide flexibility and support for more complex use cases, Hudi also offers a pluggable interface. This allows users to implement custom key generators tailored to their specific requirements.\nTo create a custom key generator, you can extend the ",(0,n.jsx)(t.a,{href:"https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/master/hudi-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/keygen/BaseKeyGenerator.java",children:"BaseKeyGenerator"})," class which itself extends the ",(0,n.jsx)(t.a,{href:"https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/master/hudi-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/keygen/KeyGenerator.java",children:"KeyGenerator"}),"  class and implement methods such as getRecordKey and getPartitionKey. This enables you to define the specific logic required for calculating record and partition keys tailored to your dataset's requirements. Additionally, Hudi includes a variety of built-in key generators that address many common scenarios discussed in the previous section, streamlining the process of key generation for users.\nThe key generator is configured at the table level and stored in the hoodie.properties file, which resides within the .hoodie directory.
