Hudi ensures atomic writes, by way of publishing commits atomically to the timeline, stamped with an instant time that denotes the time at which the action is deemed to have occurred. Unlike general purpose file version control, Hudi draws clear distinction between writer processes (that issue user\u2019s upserts/deletes), table services (that write data/metadata to optimize/perform bookkeeping) and readers (that execute queries and read data). Hudi provides snapshot isolation between all three types of processes, meaning they all operate on a consistent snapshot of the table. Hudi provides optimistic concurrency control (OCC) between writers, while providing lock-free, non-blocking Multiversion Concurrency Control (MVCC) based concurrency control between writers and table-services and between different table services.","sidebar":"docs"},"configurations":{"id":"configurations","title":"All Configurations","description":"This page covers the different ways of configuring your job to write/read Hudi tables.

Hudi also incorporates essential table services that are tightly integrated with the database kernel. These services can be executed automatically across both ingested and derived data to manage various aspects such as table bookkeeping, metadata, and storage layout. This integration along with various platform-specific services extends Hudi\'s role from being just a \'table format\' to a comprehensive and robust data lakehouse platform.","sidebar":"docs"},"ibm_cos_hoodie":{"id":"ibm_cos_hoodie","title":"IBM Cloud","description":"In this page, we explain how to get your Hudi spark job to store into IBM Cloud Object Storage.","sidebar":"docs"},"indexing":{"id":"indexing","title":"Indexing","description":"Indexing","sidebar":"docs"},"ingestion_flink":{"id":"ingestion_flink","title":"Using Flink","description":"CDC Ingestion","sidebar":"docs"},"ingestion_kafka_connect":{"id":"ingestion_kafka_connect","title":"Using Kafka Connect","description":"Try out the new experimental release of Hudi Kafka Connect Sink.
