However, with some understanding of the serialization, looking beyond the APIs used and focus on what the serialized bytes are, its possible to integrate Hudi from outside the JVM. For e.g Bloom filters are serialized as hex strings, from byte arrays/primitive types, and should be ',(0,n.jsx)(i.strong,{children:"readable cross language"}),". The Hudi Log Format bytes and layout are clearly defined as well, the header/footers are also binary serialized only with primitive types/byte arrays. So with the right endianity information and documentation of these bytes, ",(0,n.jsx)(i.strong,{children:"cross jvm clients can read this"}),". The Hudi metadata table uses ",(0,n.jsx)(i.a,{href:"https://hbase.apache.org/book.html#_hfile_format_2",children:"HFile format"})," as the base file format, which while being a well-documented open file format with clear protobuf specifications, does not have native readers.

Going forward, Hudi community plans on improving the ",(0,n.jsx)(i.a,{href:"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/7080",children:"table APIs"})," to facilitate faster engine integrations, including native language support, as a big part of the ",(0,n.jsx)(i.a,{href:"https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/master/rfc/rfc-69/rfc-69.md",children:"Hudi 1.0"})," format changes to generalize Hudi more."]}),"\n",(0,n.jsxs)(i.p,{children:[(0,n.jsx)(i.strong,{children:(0,n.jsx)(i.em,{children:"Note"})}),": ",(0,n.jsx)(i.em,{children:"In a recent release the delete block keys were unintentionally serialized as kryo, and is being fixed in the 0.14 release.
