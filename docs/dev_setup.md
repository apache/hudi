### Code Style

 We have embraced the code style largely based on [google format](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).
 Please setup your IDE with style files from [here](../style/)
 We also recommend setting up the [Save Action Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7642-save-actions) to auto format & organize imports on save.
 The Maven Compilation life-cycle will fail if there are checkstyle violations.
