## Adoption

#### Uber

Hoodie was originally developed at [Uber](https://uber.com), to achieve [low latency database ingestion, with high efficiency](http://www.slideshare.net/vinothchandar/hadoop-strata-talk-uber-your-hadoop-has-arrived/32).
It has been in production since Aug 2016, powering ~100 highly business critical tables on Hadoop, worth 100s of TBs(including top 10 including trips,riders,partners).
It also powers several incremental Hive ETL pipelines and being currently integrated into Uber's data dispersal system.
