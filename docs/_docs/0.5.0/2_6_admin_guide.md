Admins/ops can gain visibility into Hudi datasets/pipelines in the following ways

 - [Administering via the Admin CLI](#admin-cli)
 - [Graphite metrics](#metrics)
 - [Spark UI of the Hudi Application](#spark-ui)

This section provides a glimpse into each of these, with some general guidance on [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)

## Admin CLI

Once hudi has been built, the shell can be fired by via  `cd hudi-cli && ./hudi-cli.sh`.
A hudi dataset resides on DFS, in a location referred to as the **basePath** and we would need this location in order to connect to a Hudi dataset.
Hudi library effectively manages this dataset internally, using .hoodie subfolder to track all metadata

To initialize a hudi table, use the following command.

```java
18/09/06 15:56:52 INFO annotation.AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor: JSR-330 'javax.inject.Inject' annotation found and supported for autowiring
============================================
*                                          *

*    | |__| |       __| |  -               *
*    |  __  ||   | / _` | ||               *
*    | |  | ||   || (_| | ||               *
*    |_|  |_|\___/ \____/ ||               *
*                                          *

    | hoodie.archivelog.folder|                              |
```

Following is a sample command to connect to a Hudi dataset contains uber trips.

```java
hoodie:trips->connect --path /app/uber/trips

hoodie:trips->
```


### Inspecting Commits

The task of upserting or inserting a batch of incoming records is known as a **commit** in Hudi. A commit provides basic atomicity guarantees such that only commited data is available for querying.
Each commit has a monotonically increasing string/number called the **commit number**. Typically, this is the time at which we started the commit.

To view some basic information about the last 10 commits,


```java
hoodie:trips->commits show --sortBy "Total Bytes Written" --desc true --limit 10
    ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
    | CommitTime    | Total Bytes Written| Total Files Added| Total Files Updated| Total Partitions Written| Total Records Written| Total Update Records Written| Total Errors|
    |=======================================================================================================================================================================|
    ....
    ....
    ....
hoodie:trips->
```

At the start of each write, Hudi also writes a .inflight commit to the .hoodie folder. You can use the timestamp there to estimate how long the commit has been inflight


```java
$ hdfs dfs -ls /app/uber/trips/.hoodie/*.inflight
-rw-r--r--   3 vinoth supergroup     321984 2016-10-05 23:18 /app/uber/trips/.hoodie/20161005225920.inflight
```


### Drilling Down to a specific Commit

To understand how the writes spread across specific partiions,


```java
hoodie:trips->commit showpartitions --commit 20161005165855 --sortBy "Total Bytes Written" --desc true --limit 10
    __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
    | Partition Path| Total Files Added| Total Files Updated| Total Records Inserted| Total Records Updated| Total Bytes Written| Total Errors|
    |=========================================================================================================================================|
     ....
     ....
```

If you need file level granularity , we can do the following


```java
hoodie:trips->commit showfiles --commit 20161005165855 --sortBy "Partition Path"
    ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
    | Partition Path| File ID                             | Previous Commit| Total Records Updated| Total Records Written| Total Bytes Written| Total Errors|
    |=======================================================================================================================================================|
    ....
    ....
```


### FileSystem View

Hudi views each partition as a collection of file-groups with each file-group containing a list of file-slices in commit
order (See Concepts). The below commands allow users to view the file-slices for a data-set.

```java
 hoodie:stock_ticks_mor->show fsview all
 ....
  _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
 | Partition | FileId | Base-Instant | Data-File | Data-File Size| Num Delta Files| Total Delta File Size| Delta Files |

 hoodie:stock_ticks_mor->
```


### Statistics

Since Hudi directly manages file sizes for DFS dataset, it might be good to get an overall picture


```java
hoodie:trips->stats filesizes --partitionPath 2016/09/01 --sortBy "95th" --desc true --limit 10
    ________________________________________________________________________________________________
    | CommitTime    | Min     | 10th    | 50th    | avg     | 95th    | Max     | NumFiles| StdDev  |
    |===============================================================================================|
    | <COMMIT_ID>   | 93.9 MB | 93.9 MB | 93.9 MB | 93.9 MB | 93.9 MB | 93.9 MB | 2       | 2.3 KB  |
    ....
    ....
```

In case of Hudi write taking much longer, it might be good to see the write amplification for any sudden increases


```java
hoodie:trips->stats wa
    __________________________________________________________________________
    | CommitTime    | Total Upserted| Total Written| Write Amplifiation Factor|
    |=========================================================================|
    ....
    ....
```


### Archived Commits

In order to limit the amount of growth of .commit files on DFS, Hudi archives older .commit files (with due respect to the cleaner policy) into a commits.archived file.
This is a sequence file that contains a mapping from commitNumber => json with raw information about the commit (same that is nicely rolled up above).


### Compactions

To get an idea of the lag between compaction and writer applications, use the below command to list down all
pending compactions.

```java
hoodie:trips->compactions show all
     ___________________________________________________________________
    | Compaction Instant Time| State    | Total FileIds to be Compacted|
    |==================================================================|
    | <INSTANT_1>            | REQUESTED| 35                           |
    | <INSTANT_2>            | INFLIGHT | 27                           |
```

To inspect a specific compaction plan, use

```java
hoodie:trips->compaction show --instant <INSTANT_1>
    _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
    | Partition Path| File Id | Base Instant  | Data File Path                                    | Total Delta Files| getMetrics                                                                                                                    |
    |================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
    | 2018/07/17    | <UUID>  | <INSTANT_1>   | viewfs://ns-default/.../../UUID_<INSTANT>.parquet | 1                | {TOTAL_LOG_FILES=1.0, TOTAL_IO_READ_MB=1230.0, TOTAL_LOG_FILES_SIZE=2.51255751E8, TOTAL_IO_WRITE_MB=991.0, TOTAL_IO_MB=2221.0}|

```

To manually schedule or run a compaction, use the below command. This command uses spark launcher to perform compaction
operations. 

**NOTE:** Make sure no other application is scheduling compaction for this dataset concurrently

```

**NOTE:** The following commands must be executed without any other writer/ingestion application running.
{: .notice--warning}

Sometimes, it becomes necessary to remove a fileId from a compaction-plan inorder to speed-up or unblock compaction
operation. Any new log-files that happened on this file after the compaction got scheduled will be safely renamed
so that are preserved. Hudi provides the following CLI to support it


### UnScheduling Compaction

```java
hoodie:trips->compaction unscheduleFileId --fileId <FileUUID>
....
No File renames needed to unschedule file from pending compaction. Operation successful.
```

In other cases, an entire compaction plan needs to be reverted. This is supported by the following CLI

```java
hoodie:trips->compaction unschedule --compactionInstant <compactionInstant>
.....
No File renames needed to unschedule pending compaction. Operation successful.
```

### Repair Compaction

The above compaction unscheduling operations could sometimes fail partially (e:g -> DFS temporarily unavailable). With
partial failures, the compaction operation could become inconsistent with the state of file-slices. When you run
`compaction validate`, you can notice invalid compaction operations if there is one.  In these cases, the repair
command comes to the rescue, it will rearrange the file-slices so that there is no loss and the file-slices are
consistent with the compaction plan

```java
hoodie:stock_ticks_mor->compaction repair --instant 20181005222611
......
Compaction successfully repaired
.....
```


## Metrics {#metrics}

Once the Hudi Client is configured with the right datasetname and environment for metrics, it produces the following graphite metrics, that aid in debugging hudi datasets

 - **Commit Duration** - This is amount of time it took to successfully commit a batch of records
 - **Rollback Duration** - Similarly, amount of time taken to undo partial data left over by a failed commit (happens everytime automatically after a failing write)
 - **File Level metrics** - Shows the amount of new files added, versions, deleted (cleaned) in each commit
 - **Record Level Metrics** - Total records inserted/updated etc per commit
 - **Partition Level metrics** - number of partitions upserted (super useful to understand sudden spikes in commit duration)

These metrics can then be plotted on a standard tool like grafana. Below is a sample commit duration chart.

## Troubleshooting Failures {#troubleshooting}

Section below generally aids in debugging Hudi failures. Off the bat, the following metadata is added to every record to help triage  issues easily using standard Hadoop SQL engines (Hive/Presto/Spark)

 - **_hoodie_record_key** - Treated as a primary key within each DFS partition, basis of all updates/inserts
 - **_hoodie_commit_time** - Last commit that touched this record
 - **_hoodie_file_name** - Actual file name containing the record (super useful to triage duplicates)
 - **_hoodie_partition_path** - Path from basePath that identifies the partition containing this record

**NOTE:** As of now, Hudi assumes the application passes in the same deterministic partitionpath for a given recordKey. i.e the uniqueness of record key is only enforced within each partition.
{: .notice--info}

### Missing records

Please check if there were any write errors using the admin commands above, during the window at which the record could have been written.
If you do find errors, then the record was not actually written by Hudi, but handed back to the application to decide what to do with it.

### Duplicates

First of all, please confirm if you do indeed have duplicates **AFTER** ensuring the query is accessing the Hudi datasets [properly](/docs/0.5.0-querying_data.html) .

 - If confirmed, please use the metadata fields above, to identify the physical files & partition files containing the records .
 - If duplicates span files across partitionpath, then this means your application is generating different partitionPaths for same recordKey, Please fix your app
 - if duplicates span multiple files within the same partitionpath, please engage with mailing list. This should not happen. You can use the `records deduplicate` command to fix your data.

### Spark failures {#spark-ui}

Typical upsert() DAG looks like below. Note that Hudi client also caches intermediate RDDs to intelligently profile workload and size files and spark parallelism.
Also Spark UI shows sortByKey twice due to the probe job also being shown, nonetheless its just a single sort.

</figure>

At a high level, there are two steps

**Index Lookup to identify files to be changed**

 - Job 1 : Triggers the input data read, converts to HoodieRecord object and then stops at obtaining a spread of input records to target partition paths
 - Job 2 : Load the set of file names which we need check against
 - Job 3  & 4 : Actual lookup after smart sizing of spark join parallelism, by joining RDDs in 1 & 2 above
 - Job 5 : Have a tagged RDD of recordKeys with locations

**Performing the actual writing of data**

 - Job 6 : Lazy join of incoming records against recordKey, location to provide a final set of HoodieRecord which now contain the information about which file/partitionpath they are found at (or null if insert). Then also profile the workload again to determine sizing of files
 - Job 7 : Actual writing of data (update + insert + insert turned to updates to maintain file size)

Depending on the exception source (Hudi/Spark), the above knowledge of the DAG can be used to pinpoint the actual issue. The most often encountered failures result from YARN/DFS temporary failures.
In the future, a more sophisticated debug/management UI would be added to the project, that can help automate some of this debugging.
