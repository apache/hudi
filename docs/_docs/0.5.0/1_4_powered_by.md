## Adoption

### Uber

Apache Hudi was originally developed at [Uber](https://uber.com), to achieve [low latency database ingestion, with high efficiency](http://www.slideshare.net/vinothchandar/hadoop-strata-talk-uber-your-hadoop-has-arrived/32).
It has been in production since Aug 2016, powering the massive [100PB data lake](https://eng.uber.com/uber-big-data-platform/), including highly business critical tables like core trips,riders,partners. It also 
powers several incremental Hive ETL pipelines and being currently integrated into Uber's data dispersal system.

### Amazon Web Services
Amazon Web Services is the World's leading cloud services provider. Apache Hudi is [pre-installed](https://aws.amazon.com/emr/features/hudi/) with the AWS Elastic Map Reduce 
offering, providing means for AWS users to perform record-level updates/deletes and manage storage efficiently.

### EMIS Health

[EMIS Health](https://www.emishealth.com/) is the largest provider of Primary Care IT software in the UK with datasets including more than 500Bn healthcare records. HUDI is used to manage their analytics dataset in production and keeping them up-to-date with their upstream source. Presto is being used to query the data written in HUDI format.

### Yields.io

Yields.io is the first FinTech platform that uses AI for automated model validation and real-time monitoring on an enterprise-wide scale. Their data lake is managed by Hudi. They are also actively building their infrastructure for incremental, cross language/platform machine learning using Hudi.

### Yotpo

Using Hudi at Yotpo for several usages. Firstly, integrated Hudi as a writer in their open source ETL framework https://github.com/YotpoLtd/metorikku and using as an output writer for a CDC pipeline, with events that are being generated from a database binlog streams to Kafka and then are written to S3. 
 
### Tathastu.ai

[Tathastu.ai](https://www.tathastu.ai) offers the largest AI/ML playground of consumer data for data scientists, AI experts and technologists to build upon. They have built a CDC pipeline using Apache Hudi and Debezium. Data from Hudi datasets is being queried using Hive, Presto and Spark.
