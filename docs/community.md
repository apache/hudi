## Becoming a Committer 

Hoodie has adopted a lot of guidelines set forth in [Google Chromium project](https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/become-a-committer), to determine committership proposals. However, given this is a much younger project, we would have the contribution bar to be 10-15 non-trivial patches instead.
Additionally, we expect active engagement with the community over a few months, in terms of conference/meetup talks, helping out with issues/questions on slack/github.
