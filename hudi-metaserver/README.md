# How to Compile

Firstly, make sure `/usr/local/bin/thrift` exists.
Then compile the module with maven.
Finally, the source code of thrift file generates and it is under the `src/main/thrift/gen-java`.
```shell
├── gen-java
│   └── org
│       └── apache
│           └── hudi
│               └── metaserver
│                   └── thrift
│                       ├── AlreadyExistException.java
│                       ├── FieldSchema.java
│                       ├── ...
└── hudi-metaserver.thrift

```

# How to Run a job with Hudi meta server

### Start Hudi meta server
1. modify the `hikariPool.properties` and config the mysql address. For example,
```text
jdbcUrl=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306
dataSource.user=root
dataSource.password=password
```
2. start the server
```shell
sh start-hudi-metaserver.sh
```

### Write client configurations
```shell
hoodie.database.name=default
hoodie.table.name=test
hoodie.base.path=${path}
hoodie.metaserver.enabled=true
hoodie.metadata.enabled=false
hoodie.metaserver.uris=thrift://${serverIP}:9090
```

# How to test

### Run a unit test with hudi meta server
Add the configurations mentioned in the `Write client configurations` part, and
set `hoodie.metaserver.uris=""`.

The meta server runs as an embedded one with h2 database that performs like mysql running locally.
