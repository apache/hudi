# The `source-paths` config, for example, states that models in this project can be
# found in the "models/" directory. You probably won't need to change these!

# Configuring models
# Full documentation: https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/configuring-models

# In this example config, we tell dbt to build all models in the example/ directory
# as tables. These settings can be overridden in the individual model files
# using the `{{ config(...) }}` macro.
