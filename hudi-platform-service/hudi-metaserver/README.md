## How to compile

There are two ways, if there is a thrift binary in the local, please see the first one. 
If docker is more convenient for you, please see the second way.

### Compile with local Thrift binary

Firstly, make sure `/usr/local/bin/thrift` exists, and its version is the same with the one declared in the pom.xml.

Then compile the module with maven options `-Pthrift-gen-source`. For example,
`mvn install -pl :hudi-metaserver -DskipTests=true -Phudi-platform-service`

### Compile with Docker

Firstly, make sure there is a docker in the local.

Then just compile the module as a normal one. For example,
`mvn install -pl :hudi-metaserver -DskipTests=true -Phudi-platform-service`

Attention: Apple m1 cannot install thrift by docker successfully. The script will use homebrew to do it. So make sure homebrew exits.


### Source code generated by Thrift

After packaging, the generated source code are placed in `target/generated-sources/gen-java`.
It looks like,

```text
├── gen-java
│       └── org
│           └── apache
│               └── hudi
│                   └── metaserver
│                       └── thrift
│                           ├── AlreadyExistException.java
│                           ├── FieldSchema.java
│                           ├── ...
```

## How to run a job with Hudi Metaserver

### Start Hudi Metaserver

1. modify the `hikariPool.properties` and config the mysql address. For example,
```properties
jdbcUrl=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306
dataSource.user=root
dataSource.password=password
```
2. start the server

   make sure `hudi-metaserver-${project.version}.jar` is under the directory,
```shell
sh start_hudi_metaserver.sh
```

### Write client configurations

```properties
hoodie.database.name=default
hoodie.table.name=test
hoodie.base.path=${path}
hoodie.metaserver.enabled=true
hoodie.metadata.enable=false
hoodie.metaserver.uris=thrift://${serverIP}:9090
```

## How to test

### Run a unit test with Hudi Metaserver

Add the configurations mentioned in the `Write client configurations` part, and then set `hoodie.metaserver.uris=""`.

The metaserver runs as an embedded one with h2 database that performs like mysql running locally.
